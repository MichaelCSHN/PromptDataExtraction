      "The general and efficient copolymerization of lactones with hydroxy-acid bioaromatics was accomplished via a concurrent ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and polycondensation methodology. Suitable lactones were L-lactide or ε-caprolactone and four hydroxy-acid comonomers were prepared as hydroxyethyl variants of the bioaromatics syringic acid, vanillic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Copolymerization conditions were optimized on a paradigm system with a 20:80 feed ratio of caprolactone:hydroxyethylsyringic acid. Among six investigated catalysts, polymer yield was optimized with 1 mol % of Sb_{2}O_{3}, affording eight copolymer series in good yields (32-95 % for lactide; 80-95 % for caprolactone). Half of the polymers were soluble in the GPC solvent hexafluoroisopropanol and analyzed to high molecular weight, with M_{n} = 10500-60700 Da. Mass spectrometry and ^{1}H NMR analysis revealed an initial ring-opening formation of oligolactones, followed by polycondensation of these with the hydroxy-acid bioaromatic, followed by transesterification, yielding a random copolymer. By copolymerizing bioaromatics with L-lactide, the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of polylactic acid (PLA, 50 °C) could be improved and tuned in the range of 62-107 °C; the thermal stability (T_{95 %}) of PLA (207 °C) could be substantially increased up to 323 °C. Similarly, bioaromatic incorporation into polycaprolactone (PCL, T_{g} = -60 °C) accessed an improved T_{g} range from -48 to 105 °C, while exchanging petroleum-based content with biobased content. Thus, this ROP/polycondensation methodology yields substantially or fully biobased polymers with thermal properties competitive with incumbent packaging thermoplastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (T_{g} = 67 °C) or polystyrene (T_{g} = 95 °C).\n",

      "The effect of water, temperature, and glass transition on the corrosion protection behavior of two high-temperature polymer coatings for pipelines was investigated in this study. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to characterize the effect of temperature and water on the structure and the chemistry of the polymer. The corrosion protection performance of the polymer was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The findings are summarized as follows: Dried bisphenol A and Novolac coatings experienced glass transition at 52 ± 1 and 79 ± 1 °C, respectively. The glass transition temperature of bisphenol A and Novolac coatings decreased to 42 ± 1 and 54 ± 1 °C, respectively, after soaking in water at 20 °C for 3 days but increased to 56 ± 1 and 80 ± 1 °C after soaking in water at 80 °C for 3 days. No chemical change in the polymers was detected with either dried samples or water soaked at 80 °C samples when the temperature was increased from 20 to 80 °C. Water diffusivity in bisphenol A and Novolac increased from 2.7 x 10^{-10} and 4.x1 10^{-10} cm^{2}/s at 20 °C, respectively, to 3.0 x 10^{-8} and 4.1 x 10^{-8} cm^{2}/s at 80 °C, respectively. At room temperature, both coatings exhibited good corrosion protection performance with the coating impedance in the order of 10^{12} Ω-cm^{2} and the coating capacitance in the order of 10^{-11} F/cm^{2}. The pore resistance of the coatings decreased several orders of magnitude and the coating capacitance increased several times when the temperature increased from 20 to 80 °C. During the heating and cooling cycles, the pore resistance decreased and increased correspondingly to temperature ups and downs. The pore resistance vs temperature curve measured in 3 wt % NaCl solution shifted to the lower impedance after each cycle. However, no significant shift in the curves was observed in RTIL. The effects of temperature on the impedance of the coatings were attributed to the change in the pore area fraction and the tortuosity factor of the coating associated with the thermal expansion of the polymer. The effects of temperature on the coating performance were reversible in heating/cooling cycles. The effects of water on the impedance of the coatings were attributed to the plasticization of the polymer. These effects were non-reversible in heating/cooling cycles in aqueous environments. The effects of the glass transition per se on the ohmic resistance of the coatings during a short period of exposure to heat source were insignificant.\n",

      "Cationic polyethers with imidazolium-based ionic liquid moieties were synthesized and characterized thoroughly for their properties and functions. Poly(epichlorohydrin) (poly(ECH)) was quaternized by 1-methylimidazole to provide poly(N-glycidyl-N'-methylimidazolium chloride) (poly(ECH-MeIm^{+}Cl^{-})). Anion exchange of the poly(ECH-MeIm^{+}Cl^{-}) with Li salts provided other cationic polyethers: hydrophobic poly(N-glycidyl-N'-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) (poly(ECH-MeIm^{+}TFSI^{-})) and hydrophilic poly(N-glycidyl-N'-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) (poly(ECH-MeIm^{+}BF_{4}^{-})). The 5 % thermal decomposition temperatures of these cationic polyethers are quite high (300-400 °C). Contrary to poly(ECH) (glass transition temperature (T_{g}) = -49 °C), the poly(ECH-MeIm^{+}Cl^{-}) is a polymer plastic (T_{g} = 92 °C) when completely dry. Poly(ECH-MeIm^{+}TFSI^{-}) is elastomeric (T_{g} = -12 °C), whereas poly(ECH-MeIm^{+}BF_{4}^{-}) is a plastic (T_{g} = 67 °C). Poly(ECH-MeIm^{+}Cl^{-}) rapidly absorbed a large amount of moisture from the atmosphere, changing its appearance from solid to a viscous fluid even under relatively dry conditions (23 °C, and 40 % relative humidity (RH); water uptake = 29 wt %), suggesting its highly deliquescent nature. The hydrated poly(ECH-MeIm^{+}Cl^{-}) possesses neither a glass transition nor a phase transition between -60 °C and 80 °C. The ionic conductivity of the hydrated polymer is as high as 1.8 x 10^{-2} S cm^{-1} under humid conditions (23 °C, and 80 % RH; water uptake = 72 wt %) and is dependent mainly on water uptake. The miscibility between the cationic polyethers and ionic liquids is quite high; mixtures of ethylmethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and the cationic polyethers had no phase transitions between -70 °C and 100 °C. Since the cationic polyethers were miscible with each other to exchange anions, random copolymers with desired copolymerization ratios can be prepared through simple mixing.\n",

      "Glassy Langmuir polymer films exhibit a rapid increase in surface pressure at high compression. High relative humidity typically mitigates this increase in surface pressure. In an attempt to understand the origin of this phenomenon, we investigated the effects of relative humidity on surface pressure-area isotherm properties for four different types of polymers with similar bulk glass transition temperatures: poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA, T_{g} ≈ 45 °C), poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc, T_{g} ≈ 41 °C), poly(n-propyl methacrylate) (PnPMA, T_{g} ≈ 41 °C), and poly(vinyl stearate) (PVS, T_{g} ≈ 47 °C, T_{m} ≈ 47 °C). Bulk PLGA and PVAc materials are slightly hygroscopic, although they are insoluble in water; the bulk glass transition temperatures of these polymers are decreased under high humidity conditions. Analogously, the surface pressures of Langmuir PLGA and PVAc films become significantly reduced under high relative humidity, which can, therefore, be attributed mainly to the plasticizing effect of humidity on the polymer. X-ray reflectivity (XR) measurements suggest that humidity, however, does not significantly affect the molecular-level structure of the Langmuir polymer film. Interestingly, in the case of PnPMA, although its bulk glass transition temperature is unaffected by humidity levels, Langmuir films formed from PnPMA show significantly decreased surface pressures at high humidity conditions. We confirmed that this result is not an artifact associated with surface pressure measurements; humidity does not influence the wetting characteristics of the Wilhelmy probe at the air-polymer-water interface. It appears that the humidity-dependent behavior of Langmuir PnPMA films can only be explained in terms of the effects of relative humidity on the rate of water evaporation and thus the temperature at the surface of the polymer film; high humidity suppresses the evaporation of water and thus increases the temperature of the polymer-coated interface, resulting in a softening of the polymer film. We experimentally confirmed that increasing the relative humidity from about 30-40 % to about 85-90 % has an equivalent effect on PnPMA surface pressure as increasing the temperature of the system by about 2 °C. A heat and mass transfer analysis supports this correspondence. Langmuir PVS films exhibit a completely different behavior than PLGA, PVAc and PnPMA systems; PVS forms isolated two-dimensional crystalline domains at the air-water interface, and their surface pressure-area behavior is commensurate to that of colloidal particles spread at the air-water interface. Humidity seems to affect the surface pressure of PVS through a mechanism similar to the PnPMA situation.\n",

      "Block copolymers of the ABA type, where B is polybutadiene (PBD) and A is poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA), poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) (P-t-BMA), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), or poly(isobornyl methacrylate) (PIBMA), have been successfully synthesized by sequential anionic polymerization of butadiene and methacrylates with the diadduct of tert-butyllithium to m-diisopropenylbenzene as a difunctional initiator. Block copolymers of a narrow molecular weight distribution (1.10) have been analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic mechanical analysis. These materials are phase-separated and have high mechanical performances. Special attention has been paid to the service temperature of these thermoplastic elastomers in comparison with a styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) triblock copolymer. The upper service temperature (UST) has been estimated from the temperature dependence of the tensile properties in the 25-150 °C range and found to change with the outer blocks. Polystyrene (T_{g} = 100 °C) is at the origin of the lower UST, which is however comparable to PEMA (T_{g} = 90 °C) and P-t-BMA (T_{g} = 116 °C) containing triblock copolymers of similar molecular weight and composition. PMMA (T_{g} = 132 °C) outer blocks increase the UST of the triblocks, which is further increased by hydrogenation of the PBD midblock. The higher UST has been found for a PIBMA (T_{g} = 202 °C)-containing triblock copolymer that shows an ultimate tensile strength higher than 2 MPa at 150 °C.\n",

Whereas 2,6-bis(4-benzocyclobutenyloxy)benzonitrile (BCB-EBN) could be prepared in good yield using the standard procedure (K_{2}CO_{3}/NMP/toluene/Dean-Stark trap/120 °C), other bis(benzocyclobutene) (BCB)-terminated monomers containing ether-benzophenone (BCB-EK), ether-phenylsulfone (BCB-ES), and ether-6F-benzoxazole (BCB-EBO) moieties were invariably contaminated by mono-endcapped products under similar reaction conditions. This can be attributed to a much greater activating effect of the nitrile group on the ortho-fluorides in the aromatic nucleophilic displacement reaction than the carbonyl, sulfonyl, and benzoxazolyl groups. However, the latter monomers could be synthesized (70-80 %) from 4-trimethylsiloxybenzocyclobutene and respective aromatic fluorides in the presence of CsF at 140 °C. Similar curing behaviors under N_{2} (DSC: extrapolated onset and peak temperatures at 227-230° and 260-262 °C, respectively) characterized all four monomers. BCB-EK, BCB-ES, and BCB-EBN showed melting transitions at 108, 119, and 146 °C, in that order. As BCB-EBO contained more rigid benzoxazole segments, it only exhibited a glass transition (T_{g}) at 85 °C prior to curing exotherm, after it had been previously heated to 125 °C. The following T_{g}s were observed for the cured materials: BCB-EK (201 °C), BCB-EBN (224 °C), BCB-ES (264 °C), and BCB-EBO (282 °C). The relative thermal stability according to TGA (He) results is: BCB-ES < BCB-EBN < BCB-EK < BCB-EBO. Finally, the results from thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopic, and variable temperature microscopic studies indicated that the nitrile group plays an important role in the cure chemistry, thermal, and microstructural properties of BCB-EBN.\n",

      "The toughness of polybenzoxazine can effectively be improved by alloying with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI)-based urethane prepolymers (PU) or with flexible epoxy (EPO732). The experimental results, ie, flexural testing and dynamic mechanical analysis, reveal that the toughness of the alloys of the rigid polybenzoxazine and the PU or the EPO732 systematically increases with the amount of either toughener, due to the addition of more flexible molecular segments in the polymer hybrids. The curing temperature of the benzoxazine resin (bisphenol A-aniline type [BA-a]) at about 225 °C shifts to a higher value when the fraction of BA-a in either alloy decreases. Interestingly, the enhancement in the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of BA-a/PU alloys is clearly observed, ie, T_{g} of the BA-a/PU alloys are significantly higher (T_{g} beyond 200 °C) than those of the parent resins, ie, 165 °C for BA-a and -70 °C for PU. However, this characteristic is not observed in the BA-a/EPO732 alloy systems. The enhanced T_{g} of the BA-a/PU alloy at a 70/30 mass ratio is found to be 220 °C, while that of BA-a/EPO732 at the same mass ratio is observed to be only 95 °C, which further decreases as the content of epoxy fraction increases. Furthermore, the degradation temperature based on 5 % weight loss in the thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) thermograms of the BA-a/PU alloys is found to improve with the presence of the PU, though the opposite trend is observed in the BA-a/EPO732 systems. The char yield of both alloy systems is steadily enhanced with the increased benzoxazine content because the char yield of the polybenzoxazine is inherently higher than that of the two tougheners. Therefore, the polybenzoxazine alloys with the IPDI-based urethane prepolymer, eg, the 70/30 BA-a/PU, are a promising system for a tough, high thermal stability polymeric network, suitable for both bulk and composite matrix applications.

      "The objective of the present study was to prepare and characterize the cellulose acetate (CA) pseudolatex as a semipermeable membrane provider for atenolol gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS). For the polymer film coating, it is important to relate the macroscopic properties such as tensile strength and toughness to the atomic-scale property, free-volume. Using ethyl acetate as the solvent, CA pseudolatex was prepared by a phase inversion emulsification technique. The particle size of the pseudolatex was reduced to nanometer size range by passing through a microfluidizer. Diacetin was used as the plasticizer. Mechanical properties showed a considerable decrease in their values except % elongation as the plasticizer concentration increased from 90 to 150 %. Glass transition temperatures of the CA pseudolatex membranes were 160 °C (unplasticized pseudolatex), 63 °C (90 % plasticizer), 17.6 °C (110 % plasticizer), -60 °C (160 % plasticizer), and 20.1 °C (actual film from tablet surface). Approximate F_{v} (free-volume fraction), as a function of diacetin concentration, was estimated by positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS). There was an increase in F_{v} from 5.800 to 6.082 as the diacetin concentration increased from 90 to 170 %. Tritium tracer diffusion experiments revealed that the permeability of the pseudolatex films increased as the diacetin concentration increased. The CA pseudolatex provided a mechanically strong film on bilayered osmotically controlled tablet dosage forms.\n",

      "Quasielastic neutron scattering combined with deuteration labeling has allowed us to follow selectively the dynamics of the hydrogens of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, T_{g} ≈ 220 K) in a blend with poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc, T_{g} = 315 K) (20 % PEO/80 % PVAc in weight, = 280 K). Temperatures between -10 K and + 120 K have been explored by backscattering techniques, accessing a dynamical window centered on the nanosecond range and with momentum transfers Q in the inter- and intrachain region. Two essentially different dynamical behaviors have been identified for PEO in the blend: (i) at high temperatures (≈ + 100 K) the dynamics is not qualitatively different from that of a glass-forming homopolymer (regarding spectral shape and dispersion of the time scales); (ii) close to, extremely broad distributions of relaxation times are found that do not depend on Q in the high-Q range, strongly suggesting localized dynamics. Apparently, the slowing down of the motions in the PVAc component toward leads to the confinement of PEO dynamics on small length scales. As soon as the dynamics of the more rigid polymer becomes fast enough to allow PEO long-range relaxations (≈ T_{g} + 80 K), the fast component reaches a situation of certain equilibrium, at least for length scales of the order of a nanometer. Our results perfectly agree with those reported for PEO in a blend with poly(methyl methacrylate) [Genix et al Phys. Rev. E 2005, 72, 031808]. The confined processes in both \"rigid environments\" show nearly identical features. In addition, neutron diffraction experiments with polarization analysis indicate that, while blending hardly affects the short-range order of PVAc chains, it leads to larger and more distributed characteristic distances involving PEO segments.\n",

      "Micromechanical string resonators are used as a highly sensitive tool for the detection of glass transition (T_{g} or α relaxation) and sub-T_{g} (β relaxation) temperatures of polystyrene (PS) and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The characterization technique allows for a fast detection of mechanical relaxations of polymers with only few nanograms of sample in a quasi-static condition. The polymers are spray coated on one side of silicon nitride (SiN) microstrings. These are pre-stressed suspended structures clamped on both ends to a silicon frame. The resonance frequency of the microstrings is then monitored as a function of increasing temperature. α and β relaxations in the polymer affect the net static tensile stress of the microstring and result in measureable local frequency slope maxima. T_{g} of PS and PMMA is detected at 91 ±2 °C and 114 ±2 °C, respectively. The results match well with the glass transition values of 93.6 °C and 114.5 °C obtained from differential scanning calorimetry of PS and PMMA, respectively. The β relaxation temperatures are detected at 30 ± 2 °C and 33 ± 2 °C for PS and PMMA which is in accordance with values reported in literature.\n",

      "In this study, the mechanical properties and glass transition temperature of PLA-PEG block copolymer were investigated by molecular dynamic simulation. The software package Discover in Materials Studio with condensed-phase optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies (COMPASS) force field was used for the simulation. To verify the validity of simulation results, PLA and PLA-PEG copolymer were prepared in this research and the glass transition temperature was measured by DSC. The simulation results showed that the random combination chain has more probability than the alternating combination chain to exist in copolymer structure. Furthermore, PLA-PEG block copolymer has better tensile strength but lower shear strength than PLA, which agree well with the theoretical results. The simulation values of T_{g} (PLA: 333.97 K and PLA-PEG: 326.70 K) agree well with the DSC results (PLA: 328.8 K and PLA-PEG: 321.3 K). The conclusion could be drawn from the results that molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) is a potential method for investigating the structure, mechanical properties, and glass transition temperature of PLA-PEG copolymer and may be used for other polymers and copolymers.\n",

      "Resonant microstrings show promise as a new analytical tool for thermal characterization of polymers with only few nanograms of sample. The detection of the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of an amorphous poly(d,l-lactide) (PDLLA) and a semicrystalline poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) is investigated. The polymers are spray coated on one side of the resonating microstrings. The resonance frequency and quality factor (Q) are measured simultaneously as a function of temperature. Change in the resonance frequency reflects a change in static tensile stress, which yields information about the Young's modulus of the polymer, and a change in Q reflects the change in damping of the polymer-coated string. The frequency response of the microstring is validated with an analytical model. From the frequency independent tensile stress change, static T_{g} values of 40.6 and 57.6 °C were measured for PDLLA and PLLA, respectively. The frequency-dependent damping from Q indicates higher T_{g} values of 62.6 and 88.8 °C for PDLLA and PLLA, respectively, at ~10^{5} Hz. Resonant microstrings facilitate thermal analysis of nanogram polymer samples measuring the static and a dynamic glass transition temperature simultaneously.\n",

      "Computer simulation could be a useful technique to scrutinize the properties of individual polymers as well as their blends. However, there is no work on computer simulation of thermoplastic elastomer from rubber-plastic blends. As representative example, binary compatibility of polyamide 6 (PA6) with fluoroelastomer (FKM) for a 40/60 composition of PA6/FKM thermoplastic elastomer was investigated by atomistic simulation and mesoscale dissipative particle dynamics simulation. The specific volume of PA6, FKM and their blend was studied at various temperatures to estimate the glass-rubber transition. The glass transition temperatures of pristine PA6 and FKM were found to be 336 K and 250 K respectively in line with the experimental values. The blend system displayed two distinct glass transition temperatures (348 K and 254 K for PA6 40FKM 60) as discerned from atomistic simulation. These values were also in agreement with the experimental findings. Two T_{g}s described immiscibility in the present composition. The Flory-Huggins interaction parameter χ, as determined from atomistic simulation, was estimated to be 0.25, also consistent with the experimental result. Among different potential energy contributions, van der Waals energy and torsion energy showed distinct inflection points for both the pristine polymers and their blend. These inflection points were near the glass transition temperature of the respective polymers. Polymer chain mobility depicted from the mean square displacement emphasized faster relaxation of PA6 over FKM in the blend. Dissipative particle dynamics (mesoscale) simulation suggested phase separation and dispersion of FKM in the PA6 matrix in line with the experimental results.\n",

      "A self-polymerizable quinoxaline monomer (A-B) has been synthesized and polymerized via aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions. An isomeric mixture of self-polymerizable quinoxaline monomers--2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenyl-6-fluoroquinoxaline and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenyl-6-fluoroquinoxaline--was polymerized in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) to afford high molecular weight polyphenylquinoxaline (PPQ) with intrinsic viscosities up to 1.91 dL/g and a glass-transition temperature (T_{g}) of 251 °C. A series of comonomers was polymerized with A-B to form PPQ/polysulfone (PS), PPQ/polyetherether ketone (PEEK), and PPQ/polyethersulfone (PES) copolymers. The copolymers readily obtained high intrinsic viscosities when fluorine was displaced in NMP under reflux. However, single-electron transfer (SET) side reactions, which limit molecular weight, played a more dominant role when chlorine was displaced instead of fluorine. SET side reactions were minimized in the synthesis of PPQ/PS copolymers through mild polymerization conditions in NMP for longer polymerization times. Thus, the T_{g}'s of PES (T_{g} = 220 °C), PEEK (T_{g} = 145 °C), and PS (T_{g} = 195 °C) were raised through the incorporation of quinoxaline units into the polymer. Copolymers with high intrinsic viscosities resulted in all cases, except in the case of PPQ/PEEK copolymers when 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone was the comonomer.\n",

      "A family of nine poly(ether-thioethers) (PETEs) were synthesized by the radical coupling of a dithiol and a divinyl ether to investigate the importance of organo-sulfur incorporation in solid polymer electrolytes. Two series of four polymers each were synthesized to probe both the effect of the carbon spacer length between thioether units and of the ratio of ether to thioether units. PETE samples from these two series had low T_{g} values, ranging from -50 to -75 °C, and all but two PETEs displayed crystallinity. Molecular weights between 7 and 13 kg/mol were obtained for all polymers. Taking advantage of the sulfur-centered functional group, a single polymer, PETE-1, was selectively oxidized to the poly(ether-sulfoxide) PESO-1 and the poly(ether-sulfone) PES-1. Oxidation increased the T_{g} of PETE-1 from -64 °C to -36 and -26 °C for PESO-1 and PES-1, respectively, while all three were amorphous. Of the nine new PETE polymers, two were amorphous and the addition of LiTFSI decreased the extent of crystallinity for the other seven PETE samples. An increase in T_{g} was also observed for PETE-1, PESO-1, and PES-1 with the addition of salt. PETE samples with carbon spacers of two, four, and six methylene units had generally uniform ion conductivity, near 5 x 10^{-5} S/cm at 80 °C, while the sample with eight methylene units had a lower conductivity that was further decreased by crystallinity at lower temperatures. Samples with varied ether and thioether ratios also had very uniform conductivities, similar in magnitude to samples with varied carbon spacers. Within the oxidized series, PETE-1 outperformed PES-1, which in turn outperformed PESO-1 in terms of ion mobility. The highest observed conductivity (10^{-4} S/cm) at 80 °C was for PETE-1 with a salt loading of r = 0.05. The synthetic approach described here will enable a wealth of new polymer structures to be produced with controlled functional group placement and density providing novel materials for solid polymer electrolytes, broad functional group variation, and comprehensive structure-activity relationships.\n",

On the other hand, the Tg of the P(HEMA/IA) networks increased from 88 °C to 117 °C with an increasing amount of IA in the network system. The thermal degradation reaction mechanism of the P(HEMA/IA) networks was determined to be different from the PHEMA homopolymer, as confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis.

The reaction temperature, varied from -78 to -25 °C, significantly affected the IB content in the product; the highest was obtained at -25 °C. The formation of a pentablock copolymer with a narrow molecular weight distribution provided direct evidence of the presence of active chlorine at the ends of the poly(S-b-MMA-b-S) triblock copolymer, capable of the initiation of the cationic polymerization of IB in the presence of BCl_{3}.

The furfuryl glycidyl ether and CO_{2} copolymer (PFGEC) was easy to become yellowish at ambient atmosphere due to postpolymerization cross-linking reaction on the furan ring; the gel content was 17.2 wt % after 24 h exposure to air at room temperature. PFGEC could be stabilized by addition of antioxidant 1010 (tetrakis[methylene (3,5-di(tert-butyl)-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)]methane) in 0.5-3 wt % after copolymerization. The Diels-Alder (DA) reaction between N-phenylmaleimide and the pendant furan ring was also effective for the stabilization of PFGEC by reducing the amount of furan ring and introducing bulky groups into PFGEC. The cyclization degree could reach 72.1 % when the molar ratio of N-phenylmaleimide to furan ring was 3:1, and no gel was observed after 24 h exposure to air. The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of PFGEC was 6.8 °C, and it increased to 40.3 °C after DA reaction (molar ratio of N-phenylmaleimide to furan ring was 3:1).

The adamantyl groups were able to elevate the glass transition and thermal decomposition temperatures of the host copolymers, while the carbazole groups were included to facilitate the dispersion of the added chromophores and enhance the poling process. The mass of the adamantyl pendant monomer was kept constant as the mass of the carbazole pendant monomer was increased gradually. The successful incorporation of the carbazole moiety into the copolymers was confirmed by ^{1}H NMR integration. The polymers had a predominantly trans microstructure and the cis/trans ratio did not change significantly. The polymer molecular weights increased linearly from 25758 g/mol to 56827 g/mol as more carbazole-pendant monomer was incorporated. Polydispersities ranged from 1.29 to 1.70 and elemental analysis confirmed an ascending carbon % in the polymers from 72.29 % to 76.26 %. The glass transition temperatures decreased from 240 °C to 126 °C, with the thermal decomposition temperatures (10 % loss) remaining relatively constant at between 423 °C to 394 °C, indicating the polymers had a good thermal stability.

      "Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) represents one of the most important methods for understanding mechanical behaviour of surface coatings providing a valuable link between chemistry, morphology, and performance properties. In this work, dynamic mechanical properties of several high performance industrial coatings were studied extensively. Four commercially available topcoats namely alkyd modified polyurethane (PU), economy aliphatic PU, high performance aliphatic PU and epoxy modified polysiloxane were selected based on their cure chemistries, volume solids, and overall performance. DMA was used to determine elastic modulus, glass transition temperature (T_{g}), crosslink density and creep behaviour of these coatings. DMA data were substantiated with mechanical and performance properties. Among the coatings, epoxy modified polysiloxane showed the highest T_{g} of 65.6 °C as well as crosslink density value of 2.24 x 10^{-3} mol/cc which was attributed to its superior mechanical and performance properties. In addition, topcoats were also subjected to artificial aging process in accelerated cyclic corrosion cabinet and QUV-weatherometer, respectively. The consequent changes in their physico-mechanical properties post exposure were also evaluated using DMA and correlated with other performance properties. After aging, the T_{g} increased substantially for all the coatings irrespective of their exposure type. For example, T_{g} of economy aliphatic PU increases from 38.4 °C to 52.9 °C and 51 °C after cyclic corrosion and UV-B weathering, respectively. However, crosslink densities either increased or decreased depending on the type of exposure and cure chemistries. These changes were corroborated using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy findings. The outcome of this study is expected to generate new insights into the behaviour of these coatings under dynamic mechanical stress and its relation with long term performance properties.\n",

For comparison a low density polyethylene was also studied. Four lifetimes are resolved, the longest of them (τ_{4}) is attributed to o-Ps annihilation from free-volume holes in the amorphous phase and is used to estimate the mean volume of these holes. It is observed that the hole size increases with increasing separation between the measuring temperature (T = 300K) and the glass transition temperature T_{g}, estimated with differential scanning calorimetry. Among the poly(α-olefin)s the average hole volume is the largest in poly-1-dodecene (0.205 nm^{3}, Tg = 166K) and the lowest in polypropylene (0.117 nm^{3}, Tg = 262K). A method for estimation of the glass transition temperature T_{g} from the experimental hold volumes is proposed. From comparison of amorphous and crystalline densities the fractional free volume was calculated. From this the number of holes was estimated to be 0.5-0.9 nm^{-3}. The effect of exposure of the polymers to positron radiation from the source on the o-Ps annihilation parameters was also studied. While lower poly(α-olefin)s show a more or less pronounced exponential decrease of the o-Ps intensity I_{4} as a function of time, a slight increase is observed in higher poly(α-olefin)s.

Uniformly aligned electrospun PAPBI and PAPBI/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanofibers were then produced via electrospinning of desired solutions. Self-reinforcement technique was used to fabricate PAPBI-based nanofiber reinforced films. Uniform dispersion, orientation and adhesion between carbon nanotubes and polymer improved the physical properties of resulting nanocomposites. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to identify the structures of polymer and self-reinforced nanocomposite films. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that the electrospun PAPBI/MWCNT nanofibers were uniformly aligned and free of defects. Moreover, polyimide matrix was evenly coated on the surface of electrospun nanofibers, thus, preventing the fibers from bundling together. Samples of 1-3 wt % of as-prepared electrospun nanofibers were self-reinforced to enhance the tensile strength of the films. Films of 3 wt % PAPBI/MWCNT nanofiber-based nanocomposite showed higher value in tensile strength (417 MPa) relative to 3 wt % PAPBI nanofibers (361 MPa) reinforced film. Tensile modulus of the PAPBI/MWCNT system was also significantly improved (19.9-22.1 GPa) compared with PAPBI system (13.9-16.2 GPa).

      "Poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA), a biopolymer that can be derived from renewable resources, is known for its brittleness as a result of slow crystallization rates under supercooling conditions, which is associated with the formation of large spherulites. In addition, the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of PLLA is 60 °C, such that the polymer chain is immobile at room temperature. These disadvantages make PLLA unsuitable for use in the food packaging sector. In this research, biopolymer blends based on PLLA and poly((R)-3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), together with tributyl citrate (TBC) as a plasticizer, were developed. TBC was added to increase polymer chain mobility, and to decrease PLLA T_{g} from 60 to 10 °C in blends. Furthermore, the addition of PHB as a nucleating agent to PLLA resulted in an increased proportion of smaller spherulites. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy indicated that the carbonyl group and several other characteristic peaks in blends are shifted to lower wavenumber. In addition, polarized optical microscopy experiments confirmed the results of differential scanning calorimetry, FT-IR, and wide-angle X-ray diffraction, showing that PHB enhances the crystallization behavior by acting as a bionucleation.

      "Modulated differential scanning calorimetry was used to probe the thermal behavior of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) adsorbed onto silica from solution and subsequently dried. Changes in the glass transition were studied as a function of the adsorbed amount and solvent system used to deposit the polymer. The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of PMMA was found to increase from 108 °C for the bulk polymer to 136 °C for the polymer adsorbed on silica from toluene (1.0A_{m}). For the polymer adsorbed at approximately half that amount (0.6A_{m}), the glass transition temperature increased to 158 °C. The breadth of the transition also increased from 11 °C for bulk to 61 and 58 °C for the 1.0A_{m} and 0.6A_{m} samples, respectively. When PMMA was adsorbed from a mixed solvent system (5:1 benzene/acetonitrile solution), the transition temperature and its breadth increased even further. For a sample with 0.5A_{m} adsorbed amount from the mixed solvent system, the T_{g} was increased to 167 °C and the width of the transition was increased to 65 °C. The change in thermal behavior was attributed to polymer chain confinement, resulting in a distribution of segmental mobilities different from that of the bulk polymer. Upon aging for 328 days from the original analysis date, the polymer chains in the 0.6A_{m} sample adsorbed from toluene rearranged, resulting in thermal behavior which was more like that of the 0.5A_{m} sample adsorbed from the mixed solvent system.\n",

      "Four N-vinyl-1,2,3-triazole monomers were prepared in high yields from 2-aminoethanol and α-diazo-β-oxoamides via modified Wolff's cyclocondensation reactions. Then a series of poly(N-vinyl-1,2,3-triazole)s were synthesized through conventional free radical polymerization of these monomers. The chemical structures of these monomers and polymers were confirmed by proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (^{1}H and ^{13}C NMR). The properties of poly(N-vinyl-1,2,3-triazole)s were systematically characterized by a variety of analytical techniques including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and solubility testing. The results indicated that these polymers exhibited higher glass transition temperatures (196-212 °C) than most of the commodity vinyl polymers such as polystyrene (100 °C) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (110 °C). Moreover, these polymers can be further functionalized through hydrolysis of amide groups. These results revealed that this methodology has great potential for constructing 1,2,3-triazole-containing monomers and polymers.\n",

Scanning electron microscopic showed uniform morphology of polystyrene nanoparticles and polystyrene nanoparticles-based nanocomposites engendered by nanoprecipitation cosolvent evaporation. X-ray diffraction disclosed presence of crystalline domains due to silica nanoparticles content in amorphous structure.

The thermal behavior of these networks was also compared with PHEMA homopolymer. The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of PHEMA homopolymer was found as 87 °C. On the other hand, T_{g} of the P(HEMA/MA) networks decreased from 118 °C to 113 °C with increasing amount of MA in the network. It was observed that the initial thermal degradation temperature of P(HEMA/MA) networks did not change much with the MA content. However, the thermal degradation reaction mechanism of these copolymeric networks was different from PHEMA homopolymer.\n",

      "Summary: In non-polar solvents such as toluene, Cp-Ni and -Pd complexes (Cp = η^{5}-C_{5}H_{5}) with appropriate activators have been found to induce the addition polymerization of norbornene in excellent yields, for example (Cp)Pd(allyl)/[Ph_{3}C][B(C_{6}F_{5})_{4}] gave 105 120 kg-polymer/cat-mol * h at room temperature. While the Cp-Pd system was not suitable in the presence of ester-substituted norbornenes, the Cp-Ni system, for example (Cp)Ni(Cl)(PPh_{3})/AlMe_{3}/B(C_{6}F_{5})_{3} can copolymerize norbornene with 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester in toluene to give high yields (up to 68 % in 2 h at room temperature) of copolymer with variable contents of the methyl ester monomer unit (17.4-60.7 mol- %). These copolymers have high molecular weights (= 234 100-109 500) and narrow molecular weight distributions (= 1.78-1.89). In addition, they are soluble in common organic solvents giving flexible and transparent films on casting, that show very high T_{g} in the range of 352.8 to 316.0 °C. The same Ni-catalyst system can also copolymerize norbornene derivatives with bulky substituents, ie, 2-butyl-5-norbornene and 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid butyl ester. The T_{g} of these copolymers are lower (294.9-267.3 °C) than the methyl ester-based copolymers, demonstrating that the T_{g} of the polynorbornene copolymer film can be tailored simply by changing the alkyl group of the monomer to within the range of 352 to 267 °C.\n",

The blend materials presented partial miscibility associated with hydrogen bond interaction between urethane and PMMA. Polyether flexible segment glass transition was observed at -51 °C and no significantly changes with PMMA content were observed in PU continuous phase in the blends. On the other hand, a PMMA rich phase presented glass transitions between 74 and 90 °C for blends with 80, 60, 40, and 20 wt % PU. Pure PMMA shows T_{g} of 117 °C. Besides, it was observed a broad thermal event that can be assigned to the interphase between the pure PU phase and the PMMA rich phase. PALS results showed a decrease in the average free volume size of the blends with increasing PMMA content for blends with 80 and 60 wt % PU. In addition, the relative free volume content of the samples does not change significantly. The blends with 90, 80, 70, and 60 wt % PU showed lower permeabilities than those of the PU membrane. The decrease in permeability is well correlated with the decrease in average free volume size. In the case of the H_{2}/N_{2} gas pair, selectivity increases with blend PMMA content, and no marked changes are observed for the other gas pairs. The improvement in H_{2} selectivity is associated with the increase in rigid amorphous phases, which induces a complex phase-separated morphology in the blends.\n",

It was found that the efficiency of ultrasound-enhanced hexane extraction of the DOP from PVC is 70 % and the efficiency of the separation of the DOP and other compounds from the PVC by dissolution in THF followed by subsequent precipitation was 98-99 %. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) were used to characterize the thermal behavior of PVC materials before and after extraction of plasticizers. It was found that during heating in the range 20-800 °C the total mass loss measured for the nontreated, extracted, and precipitated PVC samples was 71.6, 66.6, and 97 %, respectively. In the temperature range 200-340 °C, the release of DOP, HCl, and CO_{2} was observed by simultaneous thermogravimetry (TG)/FTIR. The effect of plasticizers on thermal behavior of PVC-based insulation material was characterized by DSC in the range -40-140 °C. It was found that, concerning the PVC cable insulation material before treatment, the value of the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) was 1.4 °C, whereas for the PVC sample extracted by hexane, the value of T_{g} was 39.5 °C and for the PVC dissolved in THF and subsequently precipitated, the value of T_{g} was 80.4 °C. Moreover, the PVC samples after extraction of plasticizers, fillers, and other agents were tested to characterize their thermal degradation.

The Tg of the PMMA structures also was measured as a function of absorbed x-ray dose. Doses ranging from 0 to 2400 mJ/mm3 were delivered to the PMMA structures prior to the Tg measurements; the Tg of the structures was found to decrease from 118 °C to 95 °C, respectively. The dose dependence of the PMMA glass transition temperature can be attributed to changes in the polymer molecular weight under exposure to x rays.\n",

PSU derivatives containing acetyl, hexanoyl and decanoyl side groups were prepared, with different acylation degrees, and their thermal and mechanical properties were evaluated. It was observed that the T_{g} of the derivatives decreases linearly with the acylation degree (AD) (184 °C for neat PSU, 169 °C and 140 °C for the acetylated derivative (PSU-A) with AD of 10 % and 19 %, respectively) and the slope is dependent on the length of the acyl group, being more pronounced for PSU-A. The thermal stability is not significantly affected. Stress relaxation tests demonstrate the influence of the side groups on the viscous response of blends of the derivatives with neat PSU (50/50 % wt), as shown by viscoelastic models. The results demonstrate the potential for the use of post-polymerization acylation to adjust the thermal and mechanical properties of PSU aimed at specific applications.\n",

Moreover, for precise study and profound understanding of the reactions, polymerization of MMA was performed with co-catalysts in the absence of ethylene and catalyst. The samples were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine glass transition temperature (T_{g}) and melting temperature (T_{m}). Molecular weights (M_{w}) were determined by methods of gel permission chromatography (GPC) and rheometric mechanical spectroscopy (RMS). ^{13}C NMR was applied for recognition of molecular structure, the number of branches, and tacticity. At first, the formation of E/MMA copolymer was expected but in the resulting polymer, two homopolymers of polyethylene and polymethyl methacrylate were obtained instead of E/MMA copolymer. After analyzing the results, it was found that two separate reactions govern the polymerization system, one coordination catalytic polymerization of ethylene, and the second Lewis acid cationic polymerization of MMA. Also, highly branched PE (315 branches per 1000 carbon atoms) with the highest M_{w} (180,500 g/mol) was obtained at 30 °C, 1 bar ethylene pressure, and 15 mL MMA. The highly syndiotactic PMMA was achieved by co-catalyst of MAO and Al_{2}Cl_{3}Et_{3} with T_{g} about 130 °C whereas PMMA generated from MMAO has T_{g} about 110 °C or less than 110 °C.\n",

Comparison of the physical properties and degradation behavior of these polymers revealed divergent characteristics arising from differences in the nature of the carbohydrate building blocks. P(IU) is more thermally stable and has a lower glass transition temperature (T_{d} = 369 °C, T_{g} = -10 °C) than P(GDLU) (T_{d} = 206 °C, T_{g} = 32 °C) and P_{1,2}(GDLU-co-IU) (T_{d} = 210 and 203 °C, T_{g} = 1 and 7 °C). While all of the polymers were stable in acidic and neutral aqueous conditions, the two analogs containing GDLU hydrolytically degraded in the presence of base. Tensile testing of the systems revealed that both homopolymers are brittle materials while the P(GDLU-co-IU) is more tough. Notably, P_{1,2}(GDLU-co-IU) was found to be a rubbery material with a low Young's modulus (0.020 and 0.002 GPa, respectively), displaying an average elongation at break of 480 and 640 %, and shape memory properties.\n",

The synthesized glycopolymers were characterized using ^{1}H NMR, ^{13}C NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The deacetylated polymers exhibited onset decomposition temperatures about 60 °C lower compared to the polymers having acetyl pendants.

The deacetylated polymers H-GP and PEO-GP exhibited T_{g} values of about -30 °C. Biocompatibility of the H-GP and PEO-GP glycopolymers was obtained by studying osteoblast cell adhesion, viability and proliferation in vitro. The cell viability showed an increase with increasing concentration of H-GP from 0.1 to 1 umol L^{-1} and then decreased with further increase in its concentration (10-1000 umol L^{-1}). PEO-GP did not show a significant variation in cell viability on variation of its concentration from 0.1 to 1000 umol L^{-1}. The significant improvement in biocompatibility with osteoblast cells in the presence of PEO-GP was considered as due to the covalently bonded PEO segment of the methacrylate glycopolymer block.\n",

Variable temperature results for the α relaxation and both temperature and pressure results for the γ relaxation regions are reported. The α relaxation exhibits standard behavior. The γ relaxation exhibits unusual characteristics such as a strong increase in peak height as temperature increases and a strong decrease in peak height with increasing pressure.

Expressions for the peak height and peak position based on a two state (inequivalent well) model and the resulting parameters are discussed in terms of the insight they provide into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the sub-T_{g} relaxation.

In particular, coating a material with polymer nanocapsules with two or more T_{g} values can endow the material with variety of properties. We introduced polymer nanocapsules onto glass substrates and analyzed the effect of polymer T_{g} on the surface properties of the coating. Core-shell polymer (CSP) particles were prepared by a two-step emulsion polymerization procedure using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, T_{g} = 105 °C) and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA, T_{g} = -54 °C) in different ratios as cores, and poly(nonafluorohexyl acrylate) (PNFHA, T_{g} = -6 °C) as shells. The microstructural and microbehavioral properties of the coating surface were found to depend on the T_{g}s of the synthesized CSP. Surface elemental distributions and chemical bonding were analyzed by XPS depth profiling to determine the behavior of the CSP nanoparticles. A core/shell nanoparticle with T_{g} = 55.81/-9.12 °C has a high probability of its core becoming located at the coating surface. On the other hand, a core/shell nanoparticle with T_{g} = -33.17.81/-28.6 °C has a high probability of its shell becoming located at the surface. Because the shell has a low surface energy, test solutions with a variety of surface tensions exhibited low wettabilities. These results allow the T_{g} values of the CSP to access the final thermodynamic equilibrium state, reveal that the T_{g} values affect the surface distribution of the functional groups of the coatings, which in turn determine its surface morphology and wetting properties.\n",

The incorporation of rigid naphthalene structure with meta-sulfonic acid groups was with the intent of improving the aggregation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains and to increase the acidity and conductivities. m-SPAEEN copolymers were readily synthesized by potassium carbonate mediated nucleophilic polycondensation reactions of commercially available monomers: 2,6-difluorobenzonitrile (2,6-DFBN), 2,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-6-sulfonate sodium salt (2,8-DHNS-6), and 4,4'-biphenol (4,4'-BP) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 160-170 °C. The sulfonic acid group content (SC), expressed as a number per repeat unit of polymer, ranged from 0 to 0.6 and was readily controlled by changing the feed ratio of 2,8-DHNS-6 to 2,6-DFBN. High thermal stability of m-SPAEEN copolymers was indicated by observed glass transition temperatures (T_{g}s) ranging from 223 to 335 °C in sodium salt form and from 230 to 260 °C in acid form (m-SPAEENH) and decomposition temperatures (T_{d})s over 250 °C in acid form and over 350 °C in sodium form in both nitrogen and air.

The 10 % thermal decomposition temperature for PHB modified with 5 % AOI was 297 °C, which was 26.8 °C higher than original PHB. The T_{g} also increased from 4 °C to around 30 °C for AOI-modified materials. Additionally, due to the poly(ester-urethane) structure and hydrogen bonding of polymer materials, the mechanical properties also improved. Thus, this modified PHB biodegradable polymer may have greater application as a biomedical material due to its enhanced thermal and mechanical properties. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2012.\n",

      "Chloroprene (CP)-based block copolymers were synthesized via the RAFT-mediated emulsion polymerization of CP using polyacrylate macro-chain transfer agents (CTAs) via a one-pot (in-situ), two-step process. The quantitative formation of hydrophobic macro-CTA in the latex in the first step and subsequent incorporation of CP monomer into the latex using a high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) in the second step were observed to be crucial for producing poly(CP)-based block copolymers. The formation of poly(CP)-b-poly(n-butyl acrylate)s were confirmed by an evident shift in the SEC traces and the ^{1}H and DOSY NMR measurements. The block copolymers exhibited microphased structures composed of the poly(CP) matrix with low Tg (-30 °C) and the poly(nBA) spherical phase with lower Tg (-50 to -60 °C), as revealed by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This study represents the first report of the controlled synthesis of poly(CP)-based block copolymers by RAFT-mediated emulsion polymerization using HIPE.\n",

      "The molecular distribution in fully amorphous solid dispersions consisting of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)-diazepam and inulin-diazepam was studied. One glass transition temperature (T_{g}), as determined by temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC), was observed in PVP-diazepam solid dispersions prepared by fusion for all drug loads tested (10-80 wt. %). The T_{g} of these solid dispersions gradually changed with composition and decreased from 177 °C for pure PVP to 46 °C for diazepam. These observations indicate that diazepam was dispersed in PVP on a molecular level. However, in PVP-diazepam solid dispersions prepared by freeze drying, two T_{g}'s were observed for drug loads above 35 wt. % indicating phase separation. One T_{g} indicated the presence of amorphous diazepam clusters, the other T_{g} was attributed to a PVP-rich phase in which diazepam was dispersed on a molecular level. With both the value of the latter T_{g} and the ΔC_{p} of the diazepam glass transition the concentrations of molecular dispersed diazepam could be calculated (27-35 wt. %). Both methods gave similar results. Water vapour sorption (DVS) experiments revealed that the PVP-matrix was hydrophobised by the incorporated diazepam. TMDSC and DVS results were used to estimate the size of diazepam clusters in freeze dried PVP-diazepam solid dispersions, which appeared to be in the nano-meter range. The inulin-diazepam solid dispersions prepared by spray freeze drying showed one T_{g} for drug loads up to 35 wt. % indicating homogeneous distribution on a molecular level. However, this T_{g} was independent of the drug load, which is unexpected because diazepam has a lower T_{g} than inulin (46 and 155 °C, respectively). For higher drug loads, a T_{g} of diazepam as well as a T_{g} of the inulin-rich phase was observed, indicating the formation of amorphous diazepam clusters. From the ΔC_{p} of the diazepam glass transition the amount of molecularly dispersed diazepam was calculated (12-27 wt. %). In contrast to the PVP-diazepam solid dispersions, DVS-experiments revealed that inulin was not hydrophobised by diazepam. Consequently, the size of diazepam clusters could not be estimated. It was concluded that TMDSC enables characterization and quantification of the molecular distribution in amorphous solid dispersions. When the hygroscopicity of the carrier is reduced by the drug, DVS in combination with TMDSC can be used to estimate the size of amorphous drug clusters.\n",

      "Novel polysiloxane derivative having adamantyl moiety in the main chain (P1) was synthesized and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TG), and X-ray diffraction analysis. P1 was obtained by bulk polycondensation without catalysts as well as solution polycondensation of novel disilanol monomer, ie, 1,3-bis[4-(dimethylhydroxysilyl)phenyl]adamantane (M1), which was prepared by the Grignard reaction using chlorodimethylsilane and 1,3-bis(4-bromophenyl)adamantane, followed by the hydrolysis catalyzed by 5 % palladium on charcoal. The molecular weight of P1 was dependent on the concentration of M1 in solution polycondensation, and the high concentration of M1 would result in the high average molecular weight of P1. P1 exhibited the good solubility in common organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform, dichloromethane, and toluene. The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of P1 determined from DSC would be dependent on the average molecular weight of P1. The highest T_{g} was 115 °C and much higher than that of poly(tetramethyl-1,4-silphenylenesiloxane) (-20 °C). The melting temperature (T_{m}) of P1 seemed to be independent of the average molecular weight of P1 and was in the range of 153-157 °C, which was comparable to the T_{m} of poly(tetramethyl-1,4-silphenylenesiloxane). The temperature at 5 % weight loss (T_{d5}) of P1 determined by TG was also comparable to that of poly(tetramethyl-1,4-silphenylenesiloxane), indicating that P1 is a new polysiloxane derivative with the high T_{g} as well as good thermostability.\n",

      "Poly(6-[4-(4-cyanophenylazo)phenoxy]x-methylene methacrylate) (P x, x is 2 or 6) were synthesized and used to study the texture of side-chain liquid crystalline polymers (SCLCPs) after photoinduced orientation. With increasing temperature of irradiated P_{2} film up to 125 °C, just above its T_{g}, 123 °C, a banded texture was observed for SCLCPs under polarized optical microscope (POM). There is no banded texture of irradiated P_{6} (T_{g}, 72 °C) film when heating to 75 °C. The formation of the banded texture is considered to be due to co-existing of in-plane and out-of-plane orientation mesogens in P_{2} film, which is explained in terms of a molecular model. Based on our experimental results, factors of irradiation light intensity, film thickness, and heating rate on the formation of the banded texture were studied in this work.\n",

      "The formation of coordination complexes between the nitrogen lone pair on poly(4-vinylpyridine) and the metal center in dichlorotricarbonylruthenium(II) is described in this research contribution. {RuCl_{2}(CO)_{3}}_{2} was chosen because octahedral d^{6} heavy-metal centers with π-acid carbonyl ligands exhibit very large ligand field stabilization energies which enhance the glass transition temperatures of polymeric coordination complexes. Relative to undiluted poly(4-vinylpyridine), which exhibits a glass transition at 145 °C, T_{g} increases by 27 °C at 3 mol % Ru^{2+}. When the concentration of Ru^{2+} is greater than 5 mol %, detection of a diffuse T_{g} above 200 °C is difficult via calorimetry because the discontinuity in specific heat decreases considerably. Ambient-temperature infrared spectroscopic data for the pyridine sidegroup in the polymer suggest that the pyridine nitrogen coordinates to ruthenium. Symmetry considerations and high-temperature infrared data for the carbonyl stretching vibrations are consistent with structural models which contain two CO ligands and two pyridine sidegroups or three CO ligands and 1 pyridine sidegroup in the coordination sphere of ruthenium. Hence, it is possible that the transition-metal salt bridges two different chains via the pyridine nitrogen lone pair, forming coordination crosslinks. Hindered mobility of this nature provides a reasonable explanation for the enhancement in T_{g} by 9 °C/mol % Ru^{2+}, up to 3 mol % Ru^{2+}. Ambient temperature infrared signals in the carbonyl region suggest that as many as five different ligand arrangements of the following pseudo-octahedral complex, RuCl_{2}(CO)_{2}(Py)_{2}, exist simultaneously at low Ru^{2+} concentrations and could be responsible for coordination crosslinks. Upon heating, the highly symmetric isomers with trans-CO ligands transform irreversibly to pseudo-octahedral structures with lower symmetry (ie, cis-CO ligands). Octahedral ruthenium d^{6} salts are attractive physical property modifiers when polymeric ligands coordinate to the metal center.\n",

      "The solid-state batch process using subcritical CO_{2} offers a unique process by which large variations in cellular structure size can be produced in PEI sheet. This research presents a processing range where cellular PEI foams can be created at like densities between 40 and 99 % relative densities to that of the solid and cellular structures vary by a factor of 100x. The PEI foams produced present an opportunity to achieve high temperature foams that can be tailored to specific densities and thus material property requirements. Sorption plots,, show that equilibrium concentrations of CO_{2} are a function of saturation pressure and sorption rate of CO_{2} in PEI is concentration dependent. Comparing PEI sheet (1.5 mm thick) saturation to that of previous work by Krause on thin films, it was found that above saturation pressures of 3 MPa, the equilibrium gas concentration of CO_{2} in sheet continues to increase linearly with saturation pressure, obeying Henry's Law unlike that found for PEI film. PEI sheet absorbs almost 40 % more gas by weight at 5 MPa when compared to PEI film. Solid-state foaming of PEI sheet for various saturation pressures is presented in . The results from this foaming study reveal a large density range that can be produced. Also from this plot we see that PEI exhibits a significant drop in the polymers glass transition temperature due to dissolved CO_{2}. At 5 MPa CO_{2} pressure, the glass transition temperature is lowered to 95 °C from 215 °C of the neat polymer. This reduction in the glass transition temperature can offer advantages in processing PEI, such as lower energy input and/or reduction in process temperatures. Microscopy of the PEI samples produced display a considerable contrast in foam morphology between samples produced at 1 and 5 MPa. 1 MPa saturated microcellular samples have cell sizes between 2 and 4 μm with cell densities on the order of 10^{10} cells/cm^{3}. When the saturation pressure is raised to 5 MPa, nanocellular structures are produced with cell sizes between 30 and 120 nm and cell densities on the order of 10^{14} cells/cm^{3}. A transition from micro scale cells to nano-scale cells was observed at gas concentrations in the range of 94-110 mg CO_{2}/g PEI. A third cellular structure was also observed when samples are saturated at 1 MPa and foamed to densities below approximately 60 % relative density. This hierarchical structure shown in has a primary microcellular structure with 4 μm sized cells. The internal cell wall is composed of a nanocellular foam structure with cells on the order of 60-100 nm. This hierarchical structure may be due to spinodal decomposition in the microcell walls. The results of this study enable the creation of high temperature PEI foams and the tailoring of foam density for application. In order to bring these materials to market, future material testing studies are needed to determine the properties of these foams. Although the mechanisms that create such a large cell size difference in PEI are still not understood, microcellular and nanocellular foams can now be created in a bulk form to determine if nanocellular foams will offer unique advantageous properties. This new result now allows for a unique opportunity to compare and contrast the material properties of nanocellular and microcellular foams independent of material and density. Many researchers in the microcellular foams community have hypothesized that nanocellular foams will offer greater benefits in mechanical and thermal properties over conventional and microcellular foams, but until now, these hypotheses have been difficult to impossible to test. The data presented in now presents a clear path to test these hypotheses by presenting the processing conditions needed to create material testing samples.\n",

      "The glass-transition temperatures (T_{g}) of some polymers reported in the literature have always been a source of great uncertainty. The values reported for poly(methacrylonitrile) (PMAN, 100 and 120 °C) are well above the value determined in this study (67 °C). It is clearly shown by FTIR and DSC work that formation of cyclic structures during the drying of PMAN, even at low temperatures, is the main reason for the high T_{g} values observed. The contributions of naphthydrine type cyclic structures and intermolecular crosslinks in the increase of the T_{g} are determined over an aging temperature interval of 90-300 °C. The combined effects of intra- and intermolecular linking cause an increase in the T_{g} from 67 to 116 °C. The hardness measurements also confirm the value determined by DSC.\n",

      "Several basic physical properties of poly(thioether ketones) (PTEKs) were studied in comparison with corresponding ether analogs, poly(ether ketones) (PEKs), and various typical engineering plastics. The water absorption of PTEK (0.13 %) was lower than that of the corresponding PEK (0.16 %), probably because of the hydrophobic nature of the sulfide group. The dielectric breakdown strengths of PTEK and PEK were much greater than that of commercially available polymers. PTEK had higher dielectric breakdown strength than PEK. Although the volume resistivity of PEK considerably decreased after water absorption, that of PTEK remained high even after water absorption. PTEK exhibited a remarkably high refractive index (n_{D}^{23} 1.66). α-Transition corresponding to T_{g} was observed at a high temperature (PTEK-1, 235 °C; PTEK-2, 269 °C) in the dynamic mechanical analysis. Young's modulus and tensile strength of PTEK were comparable to those of commercial high-performance polymers. PTEK also exhibited excellent flame resistance. Although the linear thermal expansion coefficient of PTEK was greater than that of PEEK, it was still within a practically acceptable level.\n",

      "Poly(furfuryl alcohol) (PFA) is an attractive target for the development of bio-based novolac resins. However, control of the polycondensation reaction is not well understood and side reactions are an important factor for PFA and the development of new resins. The polymerization reactions and kinetics of furfuryl alcohol and 2-furyl ethanol into polymeric resins are detailed in this work. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of reaction kinetics, molecular weight analysis, and rheology analysis confirm that the polymerization reaction rate of 2-furyl ethanol is much faster than that of furfuryl alcohol because the addition of this methyl group serves to stabilize the carbocation transition state. Side reactions, such as Diels-Alder crosslinking and in particular branching, are quantified and were found to be much more prevalent in the polymerization of PFA. The glass transition temperature was measured to be 376 K for PFA and only 294 K for poly(2-furyl ethanol). Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the alternative structure that forms in PFA that causes branching results in greater backbone rigidity causing its higher glass transition temperature.\n",

      "The miscibility of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS)/poly(butylene thiodiglycolate) (PBTDG) blends was investigated by DSC technique. PBS and PBTDG were completely immiscible in as blended-state, as evidenced by the presence of two T_{g}s at -34 and -48 °C, respectively. The miscibility changes upon mixing at elevated temperature: the original two phases merged into a single one because of transesterification reactions. Poly(butylene succinate/thiodiglycolate) block copolymers, prepared by reactive blending of the parent homopolymers, were studied to investigate the effects of transesterification reactions on the molecular structure and solid-state properties. ^{13}C-NMR analysis evidenced the formation of copolymers whose degree of randomness increased with mixing time. Thermal characterization results showed that all the samples were semicrystalline, with a soft rubbery amorphous phase and a rigid crystal phase whose amount decreased by introducing BTDG units into the PBS chain (20 <= χ_{c} <= 41). Lastly, the mechanical properties were found strictly related to crystallinity degree (χ_{c}), the random copolymer, exhibiting the lowest elastic modulus (E = 61 MPa) and the highest deformation at break (ε_{b} ( %) = 713).\n",

The radius of gyration R_{g} was found as 144.7 ± 0.2 Å, and the average MW from SANS was 95000 Da. DMF revealed to be a good solvent for this polymer. From the scattering intensity of polymer solutions for high q-data, the slope was -1.647 in almost exact agreement with the expected excluded volume exponent by Flory which is^{5}_{3} affirming the good solvent property of DMF. GPC measurements of THF solutions were evaluated based on a universal calibration of polystyrene standards resulting in a rather similar value of 1.05 x 10^{5} Da. Another series of SANS experiments was done with solutions of LiSO_{3}CF_{3} (LiTf) in the title polymer. They also showed low T_{g} values down to -50 °C at 15 wt %. The SANS results (5 and 10 mol % LiTf as referred to the monomer units) showed almost no effect of the dissolved salt on the melt conformation of the polyphosphazene (almost random coil), and thus revealed a rather small interaction between salt and polymer. We also measured the ionic conductivity of salt-in-polymer systems with concentrations from 5 to 20 wt % LiTf. The room-temperature conductivity was 1.7 x 10^{-5} S/cm at 20 wt % LiTf and is thus rather high. The low interaction between salt and polymeric solvent is in agreement with the predominance of neutral ion pairs which is often observed in such polymer electrolytes.\n",

      "A well-defined photosensitive polymer whose chromophores were bound with pH-labile cyclic acetal linkages, ie, poly[5-ethyl-5-methacryloyloxymethyl-2-styryl-[1,3]dioxane] (PEMSD), was synthesized via RAFT polymerization of EMSD monomer under a mild visible light radiation at 30 °C. Kinetic studies indicated the well-controlled behavior of this RAFT polymerization. The living character of this RAFT polymerization was confirmed by the well-controlled chain-extending RAFT polymerization using an above-synthesized PEMSD as a macromolecular chain transfer agent under this mild visible light radiation at 30 °C. ^{1}H NMR analysis evidenced the intact cyclic acetal linkages and 100 % E-cinnamyl chromophores of this PEMSD polymer synthesized under these mild conditions. Isomerization of E-cinnamyl chromophores of this polymer was triggered on exposure to UV radiation, particularly in a wave range of 254-365 nm, with strong light intensity dependence. This photoisomerization reached equilibrium at ca. 65 % Z-cinnamyl formation. On photoisomerization of E-cinnamyl chromophores, the maximum absorption wavelength (λ_{max}) of this PEMSD polymer blue-shifted from 252 nm (100 % E-cinnamyl) to 244 nm (EZ = 44:56); accordingly, its molar extinction coefficient at λ_{max} linearly decreased from 1.97 x 10^{4} M^{-1} cm^{-1} to 1.41 x 10^{4} M^{-1} cm^{-1}. Moreover, this photoisomerization improved the irregularity of polymer chains, thus its glass transition temperature linearly decreased from 119 °C (100 % E-cinnamyl) to 99 °C (E/Z = 37:63). More importantly, this photoisomerization enhanced the steric hindrance and hydrophobicity of cyclic acetal linkages and shielded the cyclic acetal linkages from the proton attack and hydration. This significantly improved the stability of cyclic acetal linkages neighboring Z-cinnamyl chromophores. On the other hand, this photoisomerization improved the irregularity and loose packing of polymer chains, leading to even more labile cyclic acetal linkages neighboring E-cinnamyl chromophores than those in 100 % E-cinnamyl PEMSD polymer. In both 100 % E-cinnamyl and partially Z-cinnamyl-isomerized cases, higher molecular weight of PEMSD polymer led to a slower hydrolysis process of its cyclic acetal linkages. This remarkable phototunable stability of pH-labile cyclic acetal linkages rendered potential applications in photosensors and light-triggered drug delivery.\n",

F-PEEK exhibited a high refractive index of 1.64 at 589 nm, whereas it showed a much lower birefringence value than a polycarbonate or a polyester. F-PEEK was amorphous and transparent at room temperature. The transmittance of F-PEEK in film state was over 80 % in the visible region. These optical properties were probably related to the cardo structure of the fluorene moiety placed on the main chain. No phase transition except for T_{g} was confirmed in the DSC analysis. F-PEEK displayed a high storage modulus (E' = 2.93 GPa) and glass transition temperature (280 °C) in comparison with commercially available poly(ether-ether-ketone) (PEEK, E' = 1.73 GPa and T_{g} 169 °C).

Photoluminescence and thermal properties of the POZO-py were analyzed in detail. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed that the glass-transition temperature (T_{g}) of POZO-py was above room temperature, which implies that POZO-py is in the glassy state at room temperature. POZO-py-(0.73) (ie, pyrene content of 0.73 %, M_{n} = 2270, T_{g} = 40 °C), having the lowest pyrene induction ratio, showed higher fluorescence quantum yields in several solvents, eg, water, or in the thin film state than did N, N -diethylpyrene-1-carboxamide (a model compound, PA), because the polymer chain prevented the molecular mobilities of the pyrene moieties. In particular, POZO-py showed strong emission (Φ_{fl} = 0.52) in glycerin, which is a highly viscous solvent.

The thermal stabilities of the PRCrs obtained by organic acid-catalyzed GTP were generally superior to those of poly(alkyl methacrylate)s. The glass-transition temperature (T_{g}) of poly(methyl crotonate) (PMeCr) (122 °C) was higher than that of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) prepared by GTP (104 °C). The 5 % weight loss temperature (T_{d5}) of PMeCr (359 °C) was also higher than that of PMMA (304 °C). The values of the total light transmittance (T_{t}) (reaching 91.9 %) and haze (<5 %) of the PRCr films were similar to those of both PMMA films and glass plates.\n",

      "H-shaped poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) was synthesized from a tetrafunctional linear PPC. First, a linear α,ω-dihydroxy PPC (1) was synthesized via the alternating copolymerization of carbon dioxide (CO_{2}) and propylene oxide (PO) catalysed by a cobalt porphyrin complex and DMAP system. A subsequent chain-end functionalization with 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl trichloride afforded a tetrafunctional linear PPC (2) with dicarboxylic acid groups at both chain ends. H-shaped PPC (3) was synthesized from 2, as the macromolecular chain-transfer agent, by further alternating copolymerization of CO_{2} and PO. Moreover, the thermal properties of 3, as determined by DSC, indicated that the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of 3 (T_{g} = 21 °C) is significantly lower than that of linear PPC (T_{g} = 30 °C). This attribute of the H-shaped topology (lowering of T_{g}) was then applied to a new self-assembly system. Thus, a PPC with two thymine groups at both chain ends (4) and a PPC with a 2,6-diaminopyridine group at the centre of the main chain (5) were synthesized and self-assembled simply by mixing at a 1:2 ratio. Interestingly, the T_{g} of the self-assembled product (from 4 and 5) was comparable to that of 3, indicating the formation of an H-shaped topology through complementary hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n",

This methodology employs para-toluene sulfonic acid for the acid-catalyzed ester interchange of dimethyl oxalate and diols. Polyalkylene oxalates were derived from dimethyl oxalate and linear diols HO-(CH_{2})_{n}-OH with three to twelve methylene groups (n = 3-12). Poly(decylene oxalate), a known polymer based on (potentially biorenewable) decanediol was synthesized in 83 % yield with this methodology and exhibited no discernable T_{g}, a T_{m} of 79 °C, and a M_{w} of 67600 g mol^{-1}. Polyarylene oxalates were derived from dimethyl oxalate and resorcinol bis(hydroxyethyl)ether (RBHE) or hydroquinone bis(hydroxyethyl)ether (HBHE), aromatic diols that can be obtained from biorenewable resources. The poly(resorcinol bis(hydroxyethyl)ether) oxalate (or poly(RBHE) oxalate) was obtained in 56 % yield and showed a T_{g} of 34 °C and a T_{m} of 156 °C. The poly(hydroquinone bis(hydroxyethyl)ether) oxalate (or poly(HBHE) oxalate) was obtained in 88 % yield and showed a T_{g} of 45 °C and a T_{m} of 190 °C. Aliphatic/aromatic polyoxalate copolymers derived from 1,10-decanediol and RBHE or HBHE in varying compositions were prepared and studied. Incorporation of the aromatic diols into the polymer chain generally afforded increased T_{g} and T_{m}. Solid-state degradation studies indicated facile water-degradation of the polyoxalates as molecular weights decreased 81-92 % over the course of 13 months in humid air.\n",

Increasing content of styrene glycol units decreased T_{m}, crystallinity and molecular weight of the aliphatic copolyesters, which concurrently decreased the tensile properties. T_{g} was raised from -47 °C for PEA to 30 °C for poly(styrene succinate). The copolyesters containing higher content of sytrene glycol units were mineralized faster into CO_{2} in the modified Sturm test.

Polymerization to low conversion in benzene gave copolymers with preferential incorporation of 2 and a tendency towards alternating copolymers with increasing amounts of 1 in the feed (1 : 1.13 with a 9 : 1 feed ratio of monomers 1 : 2). The glass transition temperatures of the amorphous polymers are in the range from 100-70 °C, with a T_{g} of poly(trimethylsilyl methacrylate) being 135 °C.

Yttrium trifluoromethanesulfonate was used in the tacticity control, and bifunctional S,S'-bis(α,α'-dimethyl-α''-acetic acid)-trithiocarbonate (BDAT) was utilized as a RAFT agent. Chain structures of the A-B-A stereoblock copolymers were determined using ^{1}H NMR, SEC, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. BDAT proved to be an efficient RAFT agent in the controlled synthesis of stereoregular PNIPAM, and both atactic and isotactic PNIPAM were successfully used as macro RAFT agents. The glass transition temperatures (T_{g}) of the resulting polymers were measured by differential scanning calorimetry. We found that the T_{g} of isotactic PNIPAM is molecular weight dependent and varies in the present case between 115 and 158 °C. Stereoblock copolymers show only one T_{g}, indicating the miscibility of the blocks. Correspondingly, the T_{g} may be varied by varying the mutual lengths of the A and B blocks. The phase separation of aqueous solutions upon increasing temperature is strongly affected by the isotactic blocks. At a fixed concentration (5 mg/mL), an increase of the isotacticity of the stereoblock copolymers decreases the demixing temperature.\n",

The heat capacities of the solid and liquid states of semicrystalline PTT are reported from 5 to 570 K. The semicrystalline PTT has a glass transition temperature of 331 K. Between 340 and 480 K, PTT can show exothermic ordering depending on the prior degree of crystallization. The melting endotherm of semicrystalline samples occurs between 480 and 505 K, with a typical onset temperature of 489 K (216 °C). The heat of fusion of the semicrystalline samples is about 15 kJ mol^{-1}. For 100 % crystalline PTT the heat of fusion is estimated to be 30 ± 2 kJ mol^{-1}. The heat capacity of solid PTT is linked to an approximate group vibrational spectrum and the Tarasov equation is used to estimate the heat capacity contribution due to skeletal vibrations (θ_{1} = 550.5 K and θ_{2} = θ_{3} = 51 K, N_{skeletal} = 19). The calculated and experimental heat capacities agree to better than ±3 % between 5 and 300 K. The experimental heat capacities of liquid PTT can be expressed by: $ C^L_p(exp) $ = 211.6 + 0.434 T J K^{-1} mol^{-1} and compare to ±0.5 % with estimates from the ATHAS data bank using contributions of other polymers with the same constituent groups. The glass transition temperature of the completely amorphous polymer is estimated to be 310-315 K with a ΔC_{p} of about 94 J K^{-1} mol^{-1}. Knowing C_{p} of the solid, liquid, and the transition parameters, the thermodynamic functions enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs function were obtained. With these data one can compute for semicrystalline samples crystallinity changes with temperature, mobile amorphous fractions, and resolve the question of rigid-amorphous fractions.\n",

      "High molecular weight poly(1,4-dioxan-2-one) (PPDX) can be readily synthesized by catalysed ring-opening polymerisation of 1,4-dioxan-2-one (PDX) using aluminium trialkoxide active species as initiator. Even though the resulting poly(ester-alt-ether) chains display good thermo-mechanical properties, they suffer from low thermal stability. PPDX is known to thermally degrade mainly through unzipping depolymerisation promoted from the hydroxyl end-groups and yielding PDX monomer. To overcome this drawback, chemical modification of the PPDX hydroxyl end-groups was first attempted with trichloroacetyl isocyanate; however, with limited success in terms of thermal stability. Interestingly, it has been shown that the copolymerisation of PDX with tiny amounts of lactones like ε-caprolactone (CL) and δ-valerolactone (VL), is an efficient way to enhance the thermal stability of the resulting polyester chains without significantly compromising the crystallinity and melting temperature of PPDX. The thermal stability of the resulting polyester chains was studied by isothermal TGA under inert atmosphere as well as under air. For instance, when PDX was copolymerised with a low amount of CL by initiation with Al(O^{i}Pr)_{3} at 100 °C in bulk, a melt-stable copolymer was rapidly formed with a composition close to the starting feed and a multiblock-like structure as shown by ^{1}H and ^{13}C NMR spectroscopy. The incorporation of 3-15 wt % of CL into PPDX chains substantially increases the thermal stability of resulting PPDX-rich copolyesters, while preserving a high melting temperature ranging between 90 and 100 °C. Furthermore, an interesting internal plasticising effect is also detected by DSC with the glass transition temperature decreasing from, eg, -10 to -22 °C in the presence of 14 wt % CL copolymerised in the PPDX chains.\n",

Empirical formula of the nanophotoadduct was found to be [Co(NH_{3})_{2}(OH)_{3}C_{6}H_{12}N_{4}]*2H_{2}O. SEM analysis revealed uniform distribution of nanophotoadduct in PTh matrix. Crystallite size and strain analysis revealed further decrease in size from 34 (nanophotoadduct) to 15 nm (nanocomposite) using different methods of analysis which were well correlated. This size reduction was attributed to the microstrain in the nanocomposite. TG revealed that the nanocomposite and PTh underwent 62 and 80 % weight loss at 1000 °C respectively which clearly indicated the higher thermal stability of nanocomposite compared to pure PTh. Little change in the glass transition temperatures of PTh (170 °C) and nanocomposite (167 °C) is observed from DSC which indicated smaller plasticizing effect of nanophotoadduct. I-V curves of nanophotoadduct showed its diode like behavior while as nanocomposite depict nearly ohmic behavior.

Both PES and the triblock show lower critical solution temperature (LCST)-type demixing behavior, while PEI exhibits upper critical solution temperature (UCST)-type demixing with epoxy resins. Reaction-induced phase separation (RIPS) in these modified systems is studied using Modulated Temperature DSC (MTDSC) as an in situ tool. The thermoplastic-rich phase of the high-T_{g} modifier will vitrify at some point, while that of the low-T_{g} modifier stays mobile during curing at the useful curing temperatures, affecting the diffusion rates of the epoxy-amine species in (to) this phase differently. By using the heat capacity signal during quasi-isothermal cure, phase separation can be measured indirectly as a step-wise decrease due to vitrification of the thermoplastic-rich phase or directly as a peak when the heat of phase separation occurs on the time-scale of the modulation. The latter effect has been detected for the first time with MTDSC in the case of RIPS.

The water-in-oil emulsions were prepared with the shell polymer dissolved in the aqueous phase by adding a low boiling point cosolvent. Subsequent removal of this cosolvent (by evaporation) leads to phase separation of the polymer and, if the spreading conditions are correct, formation of a polymer shell encapsulating the aqueous core. Poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTHF) shell/aqueous core microcapsules, with a single (mononuclear) core, have been prepared, but the low T_{g} (-84 °C) of PTHF makes characterization of the particles more difficult. Poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(isobutyl methacrylate) have higher T_{g} values (105 and 55 °C, respectively) and can be dissolved in water at sufficiently high acetone concentrations, but evaporation of the acetone from the emulsion droplets in these cases mostly resulted in polynuclear capsules, that is, having cores with many very small water droplets contained within the polymer matrix. Microcapsules with fewer, larger aqueous droplets in the core could be produced by reducing the rate of evaporation of the acetone. A possible mechanism for the formation of these polynuclear cores is suggested. These microcapsules were prepared dispersed in an oil-continuous phase. They could, however, be successfully transferred to a water-continuous phase, using a simple centrifugation technique. In this way, microcapsules with aqueous cores, dispersed in an aqueous medium, could be made. It would appear that a real challenge with the water-core systems, compared to the previous oil-core systems, is to obtain the correct order of magnitude of the three interfacial tensions, between the polymer, the aqueous phase, and the continuous oil phase; these control the spreading conditions necessary to produce shells rather than \"acorns\".\n",

All drug-polymer systems are compatible, but they become less miscible with increasing amount of PMMA. The most noticeable difference was the suppression of the crystallinity of the drug with increasing PEA content, a prerequisite for long shelf life of the drug carrier. Since the different micelles are subject to different thermodynamic stability, shell-cross-linking was carried out. Cell experiments against OVCAR-3 cell lines show a fast and efficient uptake of these nanoparticles. Shell-cross-linked micelles were found to be 2-4 times more efficient against OVCAR-3 cells at low concentrations. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the IC_{50} value of drug carriers with glassy and soft cores.\n",

      "By means of quasielastic neutron scattering, we have investigated the dynamics of two polymers, head-to-head poly(propylene) (HHPP) and poly(ethylene-propylene) (PEP), through the incoherent scattering function of hydrogens, ie, the H self-correlation function. Backscattering techniques have allowed us to cover mesoscopic time scales in the momentum transfer region 0.2 <= Q <= 1.8 Å^{-1}. For both polymers, the glassy dynamics below the glass-transition temperature T_{g} (HHPP: T_{g} = 248 K; PEP: T_{g} = 213 K) is dominated by the methyl group rotations. In the temperature region investigated in the supercooled liquid statewell above the glass transitionwe have observed a qualitatively similar behavior for both systems: anomalous sublinear diffusion with deviations from Gaussian behavior in the high-Q range. Because of the differences in T_{g}, the time scales associated with HHPP are slower than those observed for PEP in this regime. These results have been taken as reference to address the question of the dynamic miscibility in the blend system composed by a mixture of 50 % HHPP/50 % PEP. Exploiting isotopic labeling, we could experimentally isolate the HHPP-component dynamics in the blend by using a mixture of protonated HHPP and deuterated PEP. In the glassy state, we found that the methyl group dynamics of HHPP is not affected by blending. On the other hand, well above the average glass transition of the blend, the hydrogen motions in HHPP become faster in the presence of PEP. The combined analysis of these results and measurements on the fully protonated blend allowed us finally to deduce also the PEP-component dynamics in the blend in the supercooled liquid state. This dynamics is slowed down by blending but remains faster than that shown by the HHPP component in the blend. These results are discussed in the light of a recent model for blend dynamics proposed by Lodge and McLeish based on the concept of self-concentration. The experimentally observed behavior is well predicted by such a model in the Q and temperature range investigated well above the glass transitions of the polymers.\n",

      "Depending upon the fiber material, some of the experimental variables can have a profound effect on the dynamic tensile modulus vs. temperature data. With the use of an experimental fiber (25 °C < T_{g} < 75 °C; T_{m} > 220 °C; hot stretched), the effect of several variables, eg, moisture/volatiles, annealing/relaxation, frequency (strain rate), pretension, and % strain on the modulus retention term [(E_{100 °C}/E_{25 °C}) x 100] have been studied. Of these variables, pretension and especially % strain dramatically increase the modulus retention and this effect is attributed to the elastic orientation under force (EOF), ie, it exists only in the presence of tensile forces and is reversible. Such an effect was insignificant for Kevlar (T_{g} - 375 °C) and absent for steel wire. Dynamic modulus measurements at 25 °C using sonic techniques also support the EOF phenomenon in polyethylene yarns (T_{g} ~ -30 °C) but not in Kevlar polymide yarns (T_{g} ~ 375 °C).\n",

      "The thermal behavior of surfaces of polystyrene (PS) films of 80-100 nm thickness decorated with gold nanoclusters with radii ranging from 9 to 18 Å has been investigated by in situ X-ray reflectivity measurements. Recently, the embedding of tiny clustersdriven by the large difference between the surface energies of the metal and the polymerhas been proposed to serve as a nanoprobe of the glass transition temperature at the polymer surface. In the present work for the first time a systematic study of the embedding process with a variable amount of metal has been carried out. Determining the density profile by X-ray reflectivity measurements, we monitored simultaneously the onset of the embedding at a temperature T_{e} and the glass transition temperature of the whole film, which corresponds to the bulk value . We show that at sufficiently low coverages the gold clusters begin to embed at temperatures T_{e} well below, which reveals the presence of a surface layer with an increased mobility of the polymer chains. Furthermore, it turned out that there is a strong effect due to the attractive polymer-metal interactions which again suppresses the kinetics at the surface and thus leads to an increase of T_{e} with higher gold coverages. Therefore, the embedding temperature T_{e} can be regarded as an upper limit for the glass transition temperature of the free polymer surface. In the present study we found for polystyrene with molecular weight M_{w} = 220 kg/mol (M_{w} = 3.7 kg/mol) a reduction for the surface glass transition of more than 37 K (22 K) with respect to its bulk value.\n",

      "Polymer blends of polybenzoxazine (PBA-a) and polycaprolactone (PCL) of different molecular weights (Mn = 10,000, 45000, and 80,000 Da) were prepared at various PBA-a/PCL mass ratios and their properties were characterized. The results from dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) revealed two glass transition temperatures implying phase separation of the two polymers in the studied range of the PCL contents. Moreover, a synergistic behavior in glass transition temperature (Tg) was evidently observed in these blends with a maximum Tg value of 281 °C compared with the Tg value of 169 °C of the PBA-a and about -50 °C of the PCL used. The blends with higher Mn of PCL tended to provide greater Tg value than those with lower M_{n} of PCL. The modulus and hardness values of PBA-a were decreased while the elongation at break and area under the stress-strain curve were increased with an increase of the content and Mn of PCL, suggesting an enhancement of toughness of the PBA-a. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the sample fracture surface are also used to confirm the improvement in toughness of the blends.\n",

      "The acrylic monomer, 4-cyanophenyl acrylate (CPA), was synthesized by reacting 4-cyanophenol dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) with acryloyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine as a catalyst. The homopolymer and copolymers were synthesized by using free-radical techniques. Characterization by FTIR, ^{1}H NMR, and ^{13}C NMR spectroscopic analysis confirms the chemical structure. The solubility of the polymers was tested in various polar and nonpolar solvents. The polydispersity index values of polymers suggest a strong tendency for chain termination by disproportionation in all cases, and the tendency increases with the increasing GMA content in the feed. The initial decomposition temperatures for poly(GMA) (188 °C), poly(CPA-co-GMA) (280 °C), and poly(CPA) (290 °C) reveal that the thermal stability of the copolymer increases with an increase in CPA content. DSC analysis showed Tg for poly(CPA) (25 °C), poly(GMA) (74 °C), and copolymer (0.4007 : 0.5993) (39 °C) indicates that Tg of the copolymers decreases with the increase in CPA content. The copolymer composition was determined using ^{1}H NMR spectra. The monomer reactivity ratios were determined by the application of linearization methods such as Fineman-Ross (r_{1} = 0.5806, r_{2} = 0.6651), Kelen-Tudos (r_{1} = 0.5442, r_{2} = 0.6472), and extended Kelen-Tudos methods (r_{1} = 0.5372, r_{2} = 0.6352).

The low reactivity of the long-chain fluoroalkoxides and their limited solubility in organic solvents prevented higher levels of substitution. Moreover, the sodium alkoxides with two methylene residues adjacent to the oxygen proved to be unstable in solution due to elimination of NaF and precipitation of side products, and this limited the time available for chlorine replacement reactions.

      "Most aromatic poly(amic acid)s, which are precursor polymers of polyimides, are thermally converted to the corresponding polyimides via imide-ring closure formation over their glass transition temperature (T_{g}) ranges or below. In addition, it is very difficult to remove completely solvents used in the synthesis from their cast samples, due to the formation of complexes between the solvent molecules and the orthoamic acid groups in poly(amic acid)s. For these reasons, it is not possible to measure T_{g} values of poly(amic acid)s with residual solvent or of poly(amic acid)s with solvent free in conventional ways. However, in the present study T_{g} values of several poly(amic acid)s were successfully measured as a function of the content of residual solvent by the recently developed oscillating differential scanning calorimetry: poly(p-phenylene biphenyltetracarboxamic acid) (BPDA-PDA), poly(p-phenylene pyromellitamic acid) (PMDA-PDA), and poly(4,4'-oxydiphenylene biphenyltetracarboxamic acid) (BPDA-ODA) precursors. The content of residual solvent in cast poly(amic acid) samples was independently determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. By fitting the measured T_{g} values by a modified Gordon-Taylor equation as a function of composition, T_{g} values of the poly(amic acid)s in solvent free were estimated: 248.4 °C for BPDA-PDA, 283.4 °C for PMDA-PDA, and 184.4 °C for BPDA-ODA precursor. The estimated T_{g} values were correlated to the calculated Kuhn statistical segments (L_{K} values), which are the measures of chain rigidities: 62.2 Å for BPDA-PDA, 88.7 Å for PMDA-PDA, and 41.2 Å for BPDA-ODA: That is, high chain rigidity causes higher T_{g}. In addition, phase diagrams of the poly(amic acid)/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent mixtures were constructed. The number of solvent molecules bound to the chemical repeat unit were also estimated to be 1.46-2.16 in the highly dried precursors, depending on the poly(amic acid)s.\n",

Different reaction conditions, such as the concentration of additional SG-1, were tested to optimize the homopolymerizations using a Chemspeed ASW2000 automated parallel synthesizer. Best control for the homopolymerizations (polydispersity indices of 1.2-1.3) of all three monomers was achieved using 20 % additional SG-1 (relative to the initiator) at a reaction temperature of 110 °C for 2 M solutions in N,N -dimethylformamide and a monomer/initiator ratio of 100/1. Libraries of P(Amor-stat-HPA) and P(DMA-stat-HPA) were synthesized with 0-100 mol % HPA with 10 mol % increments using the optimized conditions obtained for the homopolymerizations. The resulting polymers had narrow molecular weight distributions, and their compositions, determined using ^{1}H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, were close to the theoretical compositions.

      "Atactic poly(R,S-3-hydroxybutyrate) (a-PHB) was synthesized by anionic polymerization of β-butyrolactone with potassium methoxide as an initiator. This completely amorphous polyester is capable of forming a crystalline inclusion complex (IC) with γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) adopting a channel structure. There is no evidence showing that a-PHB may form IC with either α-CD or β-CD. On the basis of these discoveries, a common IC was formed with two polymer chains, a-PHB and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), randomly distributed into the channels of γ-CD-PCL/a-PHB IC crystals. Nevertheless, in the formation of the common IC, PCL inclusion appears superior to a-PHB inclusion. Therefore, the molar ratio of a-PHB and PCL in the coalesced sample has been detected to be lower than that used in the formation of the common IC. Washing the common IC with hot water removed the γ-CD, and the molecular chains of the two polymers were coalesced. Very interestingly, only a single glass transition temperature (T_{g}), dependent on the composition, was observed between the T_{g}'s of a-PHB (~5 °C) and PCL (~-60 °C) in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of the coalesced samples. To the contrary, T_{g} of a-PHB (~5 °C) was found to remain unchanged in the physical blend with PCL. T_{m}'s of coalesced blend samples are lower than that of pure PCL, while the T_{m} of the physical blend is almost the same as that of pure PCL. These results strongly demonstrate that the miscibility of the inherently immiscible a-PHB/PCL pair has been improved in the coalesced blends.

A series of copolymers were synthesized with yields as high as 83 % for TFE-VAc, 91 % for CTFE-VAc, and 70 % for VDF-VAc copolymers. Their weight-average molar masses, relative to polystyrene, were between 120 and 290 kg mol^{-1}, and polydispersity was between 1.6 and 2.4. A range of compositions was prepared with the amount of fluorocarbon in the copolymer varying from 13 to 84 mol %, as determined by elemental analysis. Monomer reactivity ratios were estimated using the error-in-variable method to be r_{CTFE} = 0.014 ± 0.05, r_{VAc} = 0.44 ± 0.03; r_{TFE} = -0.009 ± 0.06, r_{VAc} = 0.95 ± 0.08; and r_{VDF} = -0.4 ± 0.04, r_{VAc} = 1.67 ± 0.6. Proton NMR was used to estimate copolymer composition, based on triad sequences. These data, together with the reactivity ratio data, indicate that the fluorocarbons cross-propagate with VAc and that VAc propagates randomly. All samples were characterized by DSC for T_{g} with P(CTFE-co-VAc) having a T_{g} between 42 and 53 °C, P(TFE-co-VAc) between 34 and 41 °C, and P(VDF-co-VAc) between 20 and 33 °C. Hydrolysis of vinyl acetate to vinyl alcohol (VA) in P(TFE-co-VAc) yielded terpolymers, P(TFE-co-VAc-co-VA), with >80 % of VAc hydrolyzed to VA, thereby providing a reactive functional group for further modification. Interestingly, only a small decrease in molar mass was observed after the hydrolysis of vinyl acetate to vinyl alcohol, reflecting the loss of acetic acid and suggesting that these polymers are linear. The results presented herein are particularly interesting because no surfactant (or dispersion agent) was required for apparent solubility in CO_{2}.

      "Interfacial interaction between host matrix and nanofillers is a determinative parameter on the mechanical and thermal properties of nanocomposites. In this paper, we first investigated interaction between carbon nanotube (CNT) and montmorillonite clay (MMT) absorbing on epoxy surface in a theoretical study based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Results showed the interaction energy of -1.93 and -0.11 eV for MMT/epoxy and CNT/epoxy, respectively. Therefore, the interaction between epoxy polymer and MMT is of the chemisorptions type, while epoxy physically interacts with CNT. In addition, thermal and mechanical analyses were conducted on nanocomposites. In DSC analysis the glass transition temperature which was 70 °C in neat epoxy composite showed an improvement to about 90 °C in MMT nanocomposites while it was about 70 °C for CNT nanocomposites. Finally, mechanical properties were investigated and MMT nanocomposite showed a change in compressive strength which increased from 52.60 Mpa to 72.07 and 92.98 Mpa in CNT and MMT nanocomposites, respectively. Also tensile strength improved to the value of 1250.69 Mpa MMT nanocomposites while it was about 890 Mpa in both CNT nanocomposite and neat epoxy composite which corresponds to the calculation result prediction.\n",

      "Carboxylated GAP copolymers (polyGA-carboxylate) compounds (1-7), were synthesized by the simultaneous substitution reaction with PECH, sodium azide, and sodium carboxylate in DMSO. The synthesized compounds (1-7) were characterized by various analysis tools, such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), inverse gated decoupling ^{13}C-nuclear magnetic resonance (^{13}C NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), calorimetry, and friction and impact sensitivity. These poly(GA-carboxylate) compounds (1-7) have better thermal properties owing to their lower glass transition temperatures, from -48 °C to -55 °C, compared to glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) (-49 °C) and similar first thermal decomposition temperatures (228-230 °C) in comparison to GAP (227 °C), regardless of the introduction of the carboxylate group in GAP. Moreover, poly(GA_{0.8}-butyrate_{0.2}) and poly(GA_{0.8}-decanoate_{0.2}) have higher heats of combustion (2331 and 2976 kJ mol^{-1}) and negative formation enthalpies (-0.75 and -2.02 kJ g^{-1}), while GAP has a lower heat of combustion (2029 kJ mol^{-1}) and positive formation enthalpy (1.33 kJ g^{-1}). Therefore, poly(GA-carboxylate) could be a good candidate for the polymeric binder in solid propellants.\n",

Polymerization of 1, 1-dimethyl-3-phenylsilacyclobutane in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at -78 °C proceeded in a living fashion. A linear relationship between ln[M]_{0}/[M] and time ([M]_{0} is the initial concentration of the monomer and [M] is the concentration of monomer) and a linear relationship between number-average molecular weight (M_{n}) and monomer conversion were observed. The molecular weight of the obtained polymer was very narrow (M_{w}/M_{n} = 1.09, M_{w} is weight-average molecular weight).

The experimental results reveal that the enhancement in glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of BA-a/PU copolymers was clearly observed [ie, T_{g} of the BA-a/PU copolymers in 60 : 40 BA-a : PU system for all isocyanate types (T_{g} beyond 230 °C) was higher than those of the parent resins (165 °C for BA-a and -70 °C for PU)]. It was reported that the degradation temperature increased from 321 °C to about 330 °C with increasing urethane content. Furthermore, the flexural strength synergism was found at the BA-a : PU ratio of 90 : 10 for all types of isocyanates. The effect of urethane prepolymer based on TDI rendered the highest T_{g}, flexural modulus, and flexural strength of the copolymers among the three isocyanates used. The preferable isocyanate of the binary systems for making high processable carbon fiber composites was based on TDI. The flexural strength of the carbon fiber-reinforced BA-a : PU based on TDI at 80 wt % of the fiber in cross-ply orientation provided relatively high values of about 490 MPa.

      "The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of the Nafion 117 membrane was traced by DSC step by step during the preparation of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Wide-angle x-ray diffraction and frequency response analysis were used for the determination of the crystallinity and proton conductivity of the membrane. As-received Nafion 117 membrane showed two glass transition temperatures in the DSC thermogram. The first T_{g}, caused by the mobility of the main chain in the polymer matrix, was 125 °C; the second T_{g}, derived from the side chain due to the strong interaction between the sulfonic acid functional groups, was 195 °C. During the pretreatment of the membrane, the T_{g} of the Nafion 117 membrane drastically decreased because of the plasticizer effect of water. In the hot-pressing process, the T_{g} of the Nafion 117 membrane gradually increased due to the loss of water. When the Nafion 117 was completely dried, the T_{g} of the membrane finally reached 132 °C. Thermal heat treatment was then applied to the MEA to obtain high interfacial stability; however, the membrane developed a crystalline morphology that led to reduced water uptake and proton conductivity. Therefore, the thermal heat treatment of the MEA should be carefully controlled in the region of the glass transition temperature (120-140 °C) of the Nafion 117 membrane to ensure the high performance of the MEA.\n",

DIDGE resin was synthesized from the reaction of N,N'-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)pyromellitimide with an excess of epichlorohydrin. Also, DIDAM curing agent was prepared from the reaction of pyromellitic dianhydride with an excess of ethylene diamine. Completion of the isothermal curing processes was approved by both Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy and non-isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC traces showed only the phase transitions related to the thermal degradation of the resulting thermosets. According to the thermogravimetric analyses, the DIDGE/DIDAM thermoset showed higher thermal stability at temperatures above 425 °C than the other two thermosets. While BADGE/DIDAM and PEDGE/DIDAM thermosets showed about 70 % weight loss in the thermal range of 400-850 °C, DIDGE/DIDAM thermoset was encountered with only about 40 % weight loss. The glass transition temperatures (T_{g} ) of the resulting thermosets were determined using tan δ vs temperature plots obtained from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis.

However, the BF and resin exhibit poor interfacial compatibility resulting in low interfacial strength. Here, mono-, di- and tri-amino silane coupling agents (3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, SATMS; N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, DATMS and (3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)-diethylenetriamine, TATMS) were used to treat BF, and composites were then prepared using the modified BF and high-performance thermoplastic poly(phthalazinone ether nitrile ketone) (PPENK). The chemical structures, surface morphologies, roughness and hydrophilicity of the modified BF surface were characterized. In addition, the flexural strength, tensile strength and interlaminar shear strength of BF-DATMS/PPENK composite increased to 1127 MPa, 633 MPa and 55 MPa, which are 18 %, 30 % and 25 % higher than the desized-BF/PPENK, respectively. And the BF-DATMS/PPENK composite exhibited a glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of 293 °C higher than those of PPENK (280 °C) and desized-BF/PPENK (285 °C). Results indicated that the interfacial adhesion between BF and PPENK were improved by the amino-silane modified BF, which in turn enhanced the mechanical properties of the corresponding BF/PPENK composites.\n",

      "Novel block copolymers were synthesized for the first time via nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) using ethylene glycol dicylopentenyl methacrylate (EGDEMA), which has a pendent double bond in the norbornene group, and farnesene (Far), a terpene-based diene. Homopoly(EGDEMA)) was synthesized successfully using Dispolreg 007 initiator without any co-monomer as typically required of NMP, and the macroinitiator was chain-extended with Far making poly(EGDEMA-b-Far) diblock copolymers. Due to the relatively low glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of poly(EGDEMA), the methacrylate block was also copolymerized statistically with isobornyl methacrylate (iBOMA) to add stiffness, then chain-extended with Far. Additionally, the pendent double bond of EGDEMA allowed for thiol-ene clicking of POSS units for further functionalization of these block copolymers. However, the conjugation efficiency of the thermally initiated thiol-ene clicking was low and resulted in low POSS incorporation (1.6-10 mol %), especially for block copolymers that included iBOMA due to its increased stiffness and steric hindrance. Nonetheless, the added POSS improved the thermal stability by minimizing the degradation of the 1,4-addition Far units, as well as the degradation of isobornyl units of iBOMA. The mechanical strength was also increased as POSS units reinforced the physical crosslinks of these block copolymers as shown by an increase in linear viscoelastic regions. Distinct T_{g}s were observed for the respective elastomeric poly(Far) block (~-70 °C) and thermoplastic block (30 °C for poly(EGDEMA) and 110 °C for poly(EGDEMA-co-iBOMA)), therefore suggesting microphase separation. An increase in T_{g} was also observed in all polymers with added POSS, further confirming the added stiffness provided by POSS. These poly(EGDEMA-b-Far) and poly(EGDEMA-co-iBOMA-b-Far) show great versatility as alternative TPE materials, with improved mechanical and thermal properties added by functionalization of POSS.\n",

The thermal characteristics and phase behavior of MPE-PPV:[6,6]-phenyl C_{61}-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) blends were investigated by means of modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry and rapid heating-cooling calorimetry. The thermal stability of MPE-PPV:[60]PCBM solar cells was compared with devices based on the reference MDMO-PPV material with a T_{g} of 45 °C. Monitoring of the photocurrent-voltage characteristics at elevated temperatures revealed that the use of high-T_{g} MPE-PPV resulted in a substantial improvement of the thermal stability of the solar cells. Furthermore, a systematic transmission electron microscope study of the active polymer:fullerene layer at elevated temperatures likewise demonstrated a more stable morphology for the MPE-PPV:[60]PCBM blend. Both observations indicate that the use of high-T_{g} MPE-PPV as donor material leads to a reduced free movement of the fullerene molecules within the active layer of the photovoltaic device. Finally, optimization of the PPV:fullerene solar cells revealed that for both types of devices the use of [6,6]-phenyl C_{71}-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) resulted in a substantial increase of current density and power conversion efficiency, up to 3.0 % for MDMO-PPV:[70]PCBM and 2.3 % for MPE-PPV:[70]PCBM.\n",

      "The dielectric properties of methylacrylate (MA)/tri-ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TrEGDMA) copolymers at different compositions, ranging from 0 to 100, were measured between -120 and 150 °C over the frequency range 0.1 Hz-1 MHz. In the given frequency range, three relaxation processes were detected by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy in homo poly-TrEGDMA and copolymers: the α process associated with the glass transition, and two secondary processes due to localized mobility. In PMA only one secondary process was observed besides the alpha relaxation process. The influence of copolymerization going from PMA, monofunctional softer component with a glass transition determined calorimetrically as 284 K, to poly-TrEGDMA, higher glass transition component, bifunctional, that also forms a dense network due to cross linking, reflects mainly in the alpha process that shifts to higher temperatures and becomes broader. The raise and broadening in the glass transition with TrEGDMA increase was also observed by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The glass transition temperature of poly-TrEGDMA was not detected calorimetrically but a value of 429 K was estimated from the best fit of the Fox equation. In what concerns the secondary relaxation process detected in poly-TrEGDMA and copolymers at the lowest temperatures, it is related with local twisting motions of ethyleneglycol moieties, being designated as γ relaxation, while the process detected in the medium temperature range is associated with the rotation of the carboxylic groups as in poly(alkyl methacrylates), designated as β relaxation. This process is detected at much lower temperatures in homo PMA in the same temperature region than the above mentioned γ relaxation. The copolymerization influences mainly the α process while the γ process remains almost unaffected in copolymers relative to homo poly-TrEGDMA. The β process is largely determined by the presence o the tri-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate monomeric units even in copolymers with the lowest TrEGDMA content.\n",

Spectral analysis gave evidence for distinct propagating species in the two catalyst concentration regimes. At low zinc concentrations ring opening by attack of the initiating species at the acetal functionality, yielding a zinc carboxylate, followed by propagation to yield pure PMDO was implicated. At high zinc concentrations we propose that ring opening via attack at the ester functionality produced a labile zinc hemiacetal, which rapidly and irreversibly expelled acetaldehyde to form a propagating zinc alkoxide and ultimately pure PHPA. Initial rate studies indicated that the rate of PHPA formation had a second-order dependence on zinc concentration; in contrast, the rate of PMDO formation was first order in zinc concentration. High molar mass PMDO exhibited only a glass transition temperature (T_{g}) ≈ -30 °C, whereas high molar mass PHPA had a T_{g} ≈ -30 °C and a melting temperature (T_{m}) ≈ 77 °C.

A remarkable synergistic effect between the L-RD and m-Gh platelets in improving the mechanical properties and thermal properties of polyvinyl alcohol aerogel was observed; compared to pure PVA aerogels, an 130 % increase in tensile strength and a ~40 % improvement of compressive strength were achieved with the addition of 97:03 of L-RD:m-Gh, which suggests an excellent load transfer between the m-Gh and the L-Rd hybrid nanofillers. The glass transition of PVA increased from 85 to 126 °C with the addition of the L-RD/m-Gh as well. The char yield of PVA aerogels increased monotonically with increasing levels of m-Gh in the composites.\n",

      "An experimental study of the glass transition induced by solvent desorption has been performed for a series of Methyl methacrylate (MMA)/n-butyl methacrylate (nBMA) statistical copolymer films. The glass transition temperature of the dry homopolymers, PMMA and PnBMA, are, respectively, about 105 and 7 °C above the temperature of the experiment, so that the glass transition domain can be analyzed in detail by varying the solvent concentration and the copolymer composition. A strong coupling was found between drying dynamic and stress relaxation. In particular, the quantitative analysis of the desorption isotherms based on the Leibler-Sekimoto approach led to a bulk modulus K that increases as the proportion of nBMA increases, contrary to the behavior of dry annealed samples.\n",

      "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to study diffusion of methane in three highly impermeable aromatic polyesters that are good barrier materials. These are amorphous poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate) (PEN), and the nematic mesophase of the thermotropic liquid crystalline copolyester (LCP) of p-hydroxy benzoic acid (HBA) and 2,6 hydroxy naphthoic acid (HNA). Diffusion coefficients were determined in the temperature ranges of 450-625 K for PET, 500-625 for PEN, 425-530 K for the LCP, where values are large enough to be accessible to MD in practical computation times. Extrapolation, via Arrhenius plots, of the coefficients to near room temperature gave good agreement with experimental data in that region. This was found even though the glass transition temperatures (T_{g}) of PET (350 K) and PEN (390 K) lie in the intervening temperature range. This finding confirms previous observations that a low temperature hopping regime for small penetrants sets in on cooling well before the T_{g} of the host. Analysis of diffusant trajectories in terms of diffusive jump size distribution also shows that the low temperature hopping regime remains in place over the temperature range studied in these low diffusion coefficient polymers. Correlation of diffusion coefficients with free volume was examined. The LCP, even though diffusion there is highly anisotropic, is found to lie on a correlation found previously for five other polymers studied via MD. However, PET and PEN fail badly and are found to diffuse much more slowly than inferred from free volume vs diffusion coefficient behavior in the other polymers.\n",

      "The melting behaviors of gel-spun, ultra-high molar mass polyethylene fibers have been investigated using standard differential scanning calorimetry and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. For laterally constrained fibers the standard DSC exhibits the usually reported two melting peaks (one at about 415 K and one at about 423 K), a glass transition (at about 275 K) and an unusually large and reversible heat capacity as one approaches the melting peaks (starting at about 350-370 K). Earlier observations that sometimes only the lower melting endotherm is retained, are proven to be of fibers free of longitudinal and lateral constraints. Up to the beginning of major melting, all fibers are mainly orthorhombic. The orthorhombic-hexagonal transition is proven to occur only for the constrained fibers, implying that the hexagonal phase is a non-equilibrium phase, usually not present in the initial fibers. An oriented, intermediate phase, discovered by solid state NMR and full-pattern X-ray analysis, gives rise to a substantially broadened glass transition that reaches to about 300 K, compared to the glass transition of the amorphous polyethylene with a midpoint at 237 K and end at 250 K.\n",

      "The effect of comonomers, methacrylic (MAA 3-6 mol %) and itaconic acid (IA 2-3 mol %) on the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, hydration melting and thermo-oxidative stabilization of acrylonitrile copolymers has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). While, two T_{g}'s were observed, near 70 and 140 °C, for PAN homopolymer, copolymers showed another baseline shift below 70 °C. The melting point, T_{m}, of PAN and copolymer, P(AN/IA) containing 3.2 mol % of IA, has been reduced to 186 and 158 °C, respectively, in high-pressure DSC. The copolymers showed two distinct melting peaks in the first heating cycle, but the melt on subsequent cooling exhibited a single exotherm due to crystallization. The melting point of IA copolymer (158 °C) was found to be lower than that of MAA copolymer (164 °C) and PAN homopolymer (186 °C). T_{m} further decreases with increase in the comonomer content. In the second heating cycle, observed T_{m} is higher than that noted in the first heating run, indicating some amount of physical transformations. The enthalpy of fusion, ΔH_{f} decreases with the incorporation of comonomers, eg it is maximum for PAN homopolymer (57.8 J g^{-1}) and minimum for P(AN/IA) copolymer (26 J g^{-1}) having 3.2 mol % of IA content. The lower entropy of fusion (ΔS_{f}) of copolymers indicates that they are less mobile in the molten state. DSC of copolymers run in air atmosphere, at a heating rate of 10 °C min^{-1}, shows a broader exotherm compared to homopolymer. But, the broadening of exotherm seems to be more in P(AN/IA) polymers than P(AN/MAA) and the onset of cyclization shifts to a lower temperature as compared to PAN. The activation energy of nitrile cyclization, E_{a}, for PAN is found to be 30 kcal mol^{-1}. For copolymer P(AN/IA), IA = 3.2 mol %, E_{a} is 18 kcal mol^{-1}.\n",

      "The effect of saturation temperature (T_{sat}) on sorption and diffusion of CO_{2} in PMMA was investigated over the range -30 °C to 100 °C. Saturation temperature has significant effects on both the solubility and diffusivity. Solubility increases with decreasing saturation temperature, a ten-fold increase from 3.9 % at 100 °C to 39.3 % at -30 °C. A change in heat of sorption has been found to occur around 15 °C, the vaporization temperature at 5 MPa for CO_{2}. The change in heat of sorption matches with heat of vaporization of CO_{2}. The effect of temperature on solubility can be described with an Arrhenius relationship. For diffusivity, four distinct regions are identified, where diffusivity may increase or decrease with decreasing temperature, characterized by the different activation energies. As T_{sat} is lowered from 100 °C to -30 °C, a rubber-to-glass transition between 50 and 60 °C and a glass-to-rubber transition at 30 °C have been observed, which match with previously reported results. In addition, we observed a third transition from rubbery state to glassy state at 10 °C, in the vicinity of CO_{2} vaporization temperature at 5 MPa (15 °C). Dissolution of CO_{2} into PMMA plasticizes the polymer. Thus, at T_{sat} of -30 °C, incorporation of 39.3 % CO_{2} in PMMA decreases the T_{g} from 103 °C to -12.5 °C. The minimum foaming temperature, or equivalently the effective T_{g} of the polymer-gas mixture, shows a non-linear decreasing trend with the amount of CO_{2} absorbed.\n",

      "The miscibility of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)/poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) blends are investigated by atomistic molecular dynamics and mesoscale dissipative dynamics simulations. The specific volumes of three PEO/PVC blends (with weight ratio at 70/30, 50/50 and 30/70) as well as pure PEO and PVC are examined as a function of temperature. The glass transition temperatures are estimated to be 251, 268, 280, 313 and 350 K for pure PEO, PEO/PVC 70/30, 50/50, 30/70 and pure PVC. Among different energy contributions, the torsion and van der Waals energies exhibit pronounced kinks versus temperature. The Flory-Huggins parameters determined from the cohesive energy densities and the radial distribution functions of the inter-molecular atoms suggest that PEO/PVC 70/30 and 30/70 blends are more miscible than 50/50 blend. This is further supported by the morphologies of PEO/PVC blends, in which the 50/50 blend exhibits segregated domains implying a weak phase separation. Hydrogen bonds are found to form between O atoms of PEO and H atoms of PVC, with a larger degree in PEO/PVC 70/30 and 30/70 blends than in 50/50 blend. The addition of PVC into PEO suppresses the mobility of PEO chains, which is consistent with the experiment observation of decreased crystallization rate as well as crystallization temperature of PEO.\n",

      "A novel processing technique, ie high-pressure compression molding/salt leaching, was developed to fabricate ultraporous poly(lactic acid) (PLA) scaffolds. The optimized composition was studied in relation to the porosity, pore morphology, thermal property, and mechanical performance of the PLA scaffolds. At a porogen (CaCO_{3}) content of 90 wt %, the scaffolds have an interconnected open pore structure and a porosity above 80 %. It was truly interesting that the structural stability of high-pressure molded scaffolds was remarkably improved based on the fact that its glass transition temperature (83.5 °C) increased about 20 °C, as compared to that of the conventional compression-molded PLA (60 °C), which is not far from physiological temperature (~37 °C) at the risk of structural relaxation or physical aging. More importantly, the mechanical performance of PLA scaffolds was drastically enhanced under optimized processing conditions. At pressure and temperature of 1000 MPa and 190 °C, the porous PLA scaffolds attained a storage modulus of 283.7 MPa, comparable to the high-end value of trabecular bone (250 MPa) ever reported. In addition, our prepared PLA scaffolds showed excellent cellular compatibility and biocompatibility in vitro tests, further suggesting that the high-pressure molded PLA scaffolds have high potential for bone tissue engineering applications.\n",

      "Two thermal analysis techniques, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermostimulated currents, are used to characterize two Poly(ethersulfones) (PESs) obtained with the same process by two different manufacturers. The glass transition temperature observed by DSC is the same for both PESs and equal to 235 °C. When PES samples are heated above the glass transition temperature (250-260 °C), one initially white and opaque PES (B) looks transparent while the other one (A) stays in the initial stage. The PES B is visibly degraded upon increasing at a lower temperature than PES A. Below the glass transition temperature, two complex relaxation modes α and β situated at +170-175 and -120 °C, respectively, are observed. The analysis of the fine structure shows that they are constituted of elementary processes characterized by relaxation times following compensation laws. For PES A at high temperatures the cooperative movements are precursors of the glass transition. For PES B a double compensation phenomena reveals the biphasic character of the vitreous phase. The comparison between the two PESs reveals different microstructures that could be due to different processing conditions.\n",

      "Triblock copolymer (TCP)-based thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) were designed via reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer emulsion polymerization. Short isobornyl methacrylate (IM) building blocks in the two ends of molecular chain were incorporated to guarantee the mechanical properties of the TPEs at high temperature (ie, heat resistance) because of the high glass-transition temperature (T_{g}) of poly(isobornyl methacrylate) (PIM; ~180 °C). The microphase separation, tensile properties at different temperatures, dynamic mechanical properties, oil resistance, and thermal stability of the TPEs were extensively characterized. The TPEs had distinct microphase separation with a wide inter-T_{g} interval (150-185 °C). The tensile strength and elongation at break of the TPEs decreased with increasing temperature from 25 to 100 °C because of the reduced interactions in the phase domain. Even so, the TPEs had a high elongation at break beyond 200 % and little change in the tensile strength even at 100 °C together with a wide quasi-platform stage between the T_{g} values in dynamic mechanical analysis; this indicated good heat resistance. Meanwhile, the TPEs had an enhanced oil resistance and a thermal stability higher than 300 °C. These TCP-based TPEs with heat and oil resistance broaden the application potential in practical fields.\n",

The synthesis of norbornene and cyclobutene monomers containing a p-nitrostilbene moiety as the mesogenic group and polymerization of these monomers to produce side-chain liquid crystalline polymers with low polydispersities and defined molecular weights was accomplished. The relatively rigid poly(norbornene)s displayed enantiotropic nematic mesomorphism with glass transitions from 44 to 64 °C and isotropization temperatures between 108 and 121 °C, whereas the more flexible poly(butadiene)s showed enantiotropic smectic A mesomorphism with glass transition temperatures from 14 to 31 °C and isotropization temperatures between 74 and 111 °C. A diblock copolymer containing a 1:1 mixture of the poly(norbornene) and poly(butadiene) also exhibited a smectic A mesophase, clearly demonstrating the dominance of the poly(butadiene) backbone. The dependence of the degree of polymerization and flexible spacer length on the phase transitions of these systems was determined, demonstrating stabilization of the mesophase by both increasing molecular weight and flexible spacer length.\n",

The molecular weight of the polymer was in the range 3500-17 700 g/mol with a monomodal molecular weight distribution. The glass transition temperature of the polymer thus obtained was controlled by changing the silicon content in the polymer. Actually, with increasing Si content, the T_{g} of the polymer decreased from -53 (PEG) to -100 °C. PSEG having a silicon content of <15 wt % was soluble in aqueous media. With increasing solution temperature, phase separation occurred and the solution become turbid. The temperature at the phase separation is known as a lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The LCST was controlled by the silicon content in the polymer. The hydrolytic stabilities of the PSEG in aqueous solution were also examined.\n",

The changes in the resonance frequency and the inverse of the Q factor of the cantilever are related to the variations in the elastic modulus and the loss tangent of PVAc, respectively. The loss modulus of PVAc was calculated from the resonance frequency and Q factor and used to determine the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of PVAc (66 °C), which was found to be higher than that obtained from the cantilever deflection (43 °C); this difference is attributed to the high resonance frequency of the cantilever (or the fast rate of the applied stress).

      "This paper explores the copolymerization of l-lactide (l-LA) with 2,2-[2-pentene-1,5-diyl]trimethylene carbonate (^{c}HTC). Since^{c}HTC has a cyclohexene group, this provided a route for preparing poly(lactic acid), (PLA), based chains decorated with controlled quantities of CC substituents. Ring-opening copolymerizations of l-LA with^{c}HTC were successfully conducted in bulk by using AlR_{3}-H_{2}O (R = ethyl, isobutyl), Al(O^{i}Pr)_{3}, ZnEt_{2}-H_{2}O and Sn(Oct)_{2} as catalysts. Comparison of these copolymerizations showed that the Sn(Oct)_{2} catalyst system gave copolymers of relatively higher molecular weight. Increasing the reaction time of Sn(Oct)_{2} catalyzed copolymerizations from 6 to 24 h resulted in higher copolymer^{c}HTC content and yield but lower copolymer molecular weight. Variation of the comonomer feed ratio was useful in regulating the content of cyclohexene pendant groups in the copolymer. However, regardless of the catalyst used, the mole percent of^{c}HTC incorporated into the copolymer was lower than that used in the monomer feed. Determination of the comonomer reactivity ratios for Sn(Oct)_{2} catalyzed copolymerizations gave values of 8.8 and 0.52 for l-LA and^{c}HTC, respectively. All gel permeation chromatography (GPC) traces showed unimodal molecular weight distributions. Determination by ^{13}C-NMR of the copolymer sequence fractions HLL, LLL, LLH, HLH, HL, and LH (H =^{c}HTC units, L = l-lactyl units) showed that they were close to those calculated by assuming a Bernoulli statistical propagation. On the basis of these results and the effects of reaction conditions on the copolymer sequence distribution, a mechanism which involves insertion of^{c}HTC into the polymer chain was proposed. Studies by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that^{c}HTC units in the copolymers disrupted ordering of the l-PLA crystalline phase. Furthermore, the glass transition temperatures (T_{g}) ranged from 60 (l-PLA) to 33 °C (P(^{c}HTC)). Conversion of CC to epoxy side groups was successfully carried out by using 3-(chloroperoxy)benzoic acid at room temperature with only small decreases in copolymer molecular weight.\n",

Random and block copolymerizations of this γBrCL with ε-caprolactone (εCL) were also found to be living as evidenced by the experimental molecular weight which is consistent with that expected from the monomer to initiator molar ratio, the narrow polydispersity, and the good agreement between the comonomers molar fraction in the comonomer feed and the copolymer. The thermal transitions (T_{g} and T_{m}) in the εCL/γBrCL random copolymers depend strongly on the γBrCL content. Increasing the γBrCL content in the copolymer (F_{BrCL}) increased the T_{g} of the copolymer from -61 °C for poly(ε-caprolactone) to -16.5 °C for the PγBrCL homopolymer but decreased the T_{m} of the PCL to contents of ~ 30 mol % of γBrCL (F_{BrCL} = 0.3).

Model reactions for the synthesis of A_{2}B_{2} star-block copolymers indicated that the fine-tuning of Lewis acidity to the reactivity of MeVE is a crucial step for the structural integrity of the resulting A_{2}B_{2} star-block copolymers. Side products were negligible using a [Ti(OEt)_{4}]/[TiCl_{4}] ratio of 0.7 and the minimum tuning time (~5 min). Fractionation of the crude A_{2}B_{2} star-block copolymer was carried out on a silica gel column, and on the basis of the weights of fractions, the purity of the crude A_{2}B_{2} star-block copolymer was calculated to be >=93.5 %. Two T_{g}s (-60 °C for PIB and -20 °C for PMeVE) were observed for the star-block copolymer by DSC indicating the presence of two microphases.

The three POSS-containing PPVs are as follows: POSS05-PPV(containing 5 mol % POSS-appended PPV units), POSS25-PPV, and POSS100-PPV (this is the first π-conjugated polymer composed of 100 mol % POSSs-appended repeating units). These polymers were found to be completely soluble in common organic solvents, and homogeneous thin films of these polymers were fabricated easily by spin-coating onto the quartz glasses and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. The POSS-containing PPVs exhibit higher glass transition temperatures (64-77 °C) than that of MEH-PPV (58 °C), indicating that electroluminescence (EL) devices fabricated with these polymers should have good thermal stabilities. The presence of the POSSs in the PPV side chains was found to result in the lowering of the maximum wavelengths of the UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, which occurs because of the nanosize effect of the POSS moieties appended to the polymer backbones. As the POSS content ratio in the polymers increases, the maximum wavelengths of the UV-vis absorption and PL emission spectra are increasingly blue-shifted except for those of POSS05-PPV. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Ca/Al were fabricated using the novel POSS-containing PPVs. The LED devices based on the POSS-containing PPVs were found to exhibit maximum EL wavelengths ranging from 577 to 543 nm (POSS05-PPV, 577 nm; POSS25-PPV, 575 nm; and POSS100-PPV, 543 nm). The LED devices containing POSS05-PPV or POSS25-PPV emitted orange-red light, whereas that containing POSS100-PPV emitted yellow-orange light. Interestingly, the maximum brightness and luminance efficiency of the POSS25-PPV device were found to be up to 6340 cd/m^{2} at 13.2 V and 0.26 cd/A at 6190 cd/m^{2}, respectively, which are higher maximum brightness and luminance efficiencies than those of the MEH-PPV device (3880 cd/m^{2} at 14.8 V and 0.075 cd/A at 3880 cd/m^{2}). The improvements in the EL properties of PPV derivatives that result from the introduction of the POSS moieties into the PPVs and the contribution of the POSS moieties to the conjugated polymer matrixes of EL devices were also reproduced in binary blend systems composed of a POSS-containing PPV (POSS25-PPV) and MEH-PPV. Surprisingly, the luminescence efficiency (0.48 cd/A at 10540 cd/m^{2}) of the binary blend consisting of 5 wt % of POSS25-PPV and 95 wt % of MEH-PPV was found to be enhanced by a factor of 6.4 with a maximum brightness of 11 010 cd/m^{2} (at 14.3 V). It is likely that the enhanced device performance of POSS25-PPV and the binary blend consisting of 5 wt % of POSS25-PPV and 95 wt % of MEH-PPV are due to the formation of suitable insulation domains of the POSS moieties in the conjugated polymer matrixes, resulting in a balance of charge carriers, that is, of electrons and holes.\n",

      "We measure the glass transition temperatures (T_{g}s) of near-infinitely dilute (0.1 wt %), well-dispersed polystyrene (PS) components in seven blend partners using intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence. The PS T_{g}s span a 150 °C range when PS is dispersed in partners with T_{g}s of -6 to 150 °C. We calculate self-concentrations for PS (ph_{self}^{PS}) of ~0 to 0.72 via the Lodge-McLeish model, the largest range ever reported for a blend component. Our study reveals that perturbations to PS T_{g}, which may be quantified by ph_{self}^{PS} calculations, correlate with partner fragility rather than partner T_{g}, with higher fragility partners resulting in higher ph_{self}^{PS} values. In particular, for 0.1 wt % PS in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), the partner with the highest reported fragility but an intermediate T_{g}, the PS T_{g} is only weakly perturbed with ph_{self}^{PS} = 0.72. These results indicate that partner fragility plays a key role in determining the strength of T_{g} perturbations to a blend component. Also noteworthy is 0.1 wt % PS in poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) where the PS T_{g} is slaved to that of P4VP (ph_{self}^{PS} ~ 0). Fluorescent label location on the backbone does not significantly influence the measured T_{g}. However, the distance separating a label from the backbone is crucial in determining T_{g} and thereby ph_{self}^{PS}. In PVC, ph_{self}^{PS} decreases from 0.72 to ~0 when a dye is attached to the PS backbone by a methyl ester or butyl ester group, respectively, indicating a highly heterogeneous environment within ~0.45 nm of the backbone.\n",

The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of PVA (75 °C) was increased to substantially excel over that of polystyrene (PS, 100 °C), with polyvinyl aromatic acetal T_{g} values ranging from 114 to 157 °C. Heterogeneous degradation studies of polyvinyl vanillin acetal at room temperature indicated nearly complete hydrolysis over 24 hours in acidic aqueous media. For example, at pH = 1, the initial acetalization of 54 % dropped to 0.8 %, generating benign aromatic small molecules and water-soluble, biodegradable PVA.\n",

      "Critical overview of literature data on the glass transition temperature T_{g} of poly(4-vinylphenol) PVPh revealed a large scatter of values ranging between 53 and 194 °C, which can only partially be attributed to molecular-mass effect. The reason could be seen in residual moisture and/or solvent in samples subjected to insufficient or even no drying. Based on selected two thirds of literature data, a regression equation is proposed for the dependence of T_{g} on 1/M_{n}. Two samples of commercial PVPh (M_{n} 11500; M_{w} 22100) and (M_{n} 19700; M_{w} 40,900) were studied by DSC, ATR-FTIR, and SEC methods. A procedure of preparing well defined samples is proposed: PVPh vacuum-dried at 140 °C for 24 h is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and precipitated in hexane. The precipitate is vacuum-dried at 40 °C for 24 h, weighed into a pierced DSC pan. After final vacuum drying at 140 °C for 24 h, the sample is analyzed. The PVPh samples treated in this way showed T_{g} of 175.0 °C and 179.6 °C, respectively.\n",

      "The differential microemulsion polymerization technique was used to synthesize the nanoparticles of glycidyl-functionalized poly(methyl methacrylate) or PMMA via a two-step process, by which the amount of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant required was 1/217 of the monomer amount by weight and the surfactant/water ratio could be as low as 1/600. These surfactant levels are extremely low in comparison with those used in a conventional microemulsion polymerization system. The glycidyl-functionalized PMMA nanoparticles are composed of nanosized cores of high molecular weight PMMA and nano-thin shells of the random copolymer poly[(methyl methacrylate)-ran-(glycidyl methacrylate)]. The particle sizes were about 50 nm. The ratios of the glycidyl methacrylate in the glycidyl-functionalized PMMA were achieved at about 5-26 wt. %, depending on the reaction conditions. The molecular weight of glycidyl-functionalized PMMA was in the range of about 1 x 10^{6} to 3 x 10^{6} g mol^{-1}. The solid content of glycidyl-functionalized PMMA increased when the amount of added glycidyl methacrylate was increased. The glycidyl-functionalized polymer on the surface of nano-seed PMMA nanoparticles was a random copolymer which was confirmed by ^{1}H-NMR spectroscopy. The amounts of functionalization were investigated by the titration of the glycidyl functional group. The structure of the glycidyl-functionalized PMMA nanoparticles was investigated by means of TEM. The glycidyl-functionalized PMMA has two regions of T_{g} which are at around 90 °C and 125 °C, respectively, of which the first one was attributed to the poly[(methyl methacrylate)-ran-(glycidyl methacrylate)] and the second one was due to the PMMA. A core/shell structure of the glycidyl-functionalized PMMA latex nanoparticles was observed.\n",

      "Plasticizers are additives used to soften polymers, but most of them are oily or waxy and are difficult to process in a continuous hot-melt process. The plasticizing effect of four functionalized ferulic acid derivatives designed with controlled solubility parameters was investigated upon the study of both the thermal stability and the mechanical properties of polylactic acid (PLA) blends. The synthesized powders were incorporated into PLA through a continuous hot-melt process (extrusion) allowing the derivatives to turn from crystalline to an amorphous state. Such phase transition permitted the derivatives to act as plasticizers, reaching a reduction of the Young's modulus of PLA by 40 % for one of the derivatives blended at 20 wt %. Another derivative decreased the glass transition of the PLA from 56.6 °C to 26.3 °C at the same content. These works demonstrate the interest of using phase transition additives to ease the mixing of efficient plasticizers by hot-melt processing.\n",

In chlorobenzene homogeneous reaction mixtures were obtained, whereas molten copolyesters precipitated from toluene and xylene. The obtained average molecular weights indicated high polydispersities. According to MALDI-TOF MS the low molar mass reaction products (<4 kDa) almost exclusively consisted of cyclics with a composition depending on the feed ratio. The glass-transition temperatures (T_{g}) varied between the values of poly(l-lactide (64 °C) and poly(isosorbide isophthalate) (180 °C). Four polyesters prepared from 5-tert-butyl isophthalic acid displayed higher T_{g} values. Differential thermoanalysis evidenced that the thermostability decreases with higher fractions of lactide, but processing from the melt seems to be feasible up to temperatures of 260 °C without risking degradation.\n",

P1 was obtained via deprotective hydrogenation of poly(tetramethyl-5-benzyloxy-1,3-silphenylenesiloxane) (Pre-P1) catalyzed by 10 % palladium on charcoal as well as via direct polycondensation of 3,5-bis(dimethylhydroxysilyl)phenol (M2). Pre-P1 was obtained by polycondensation of 1,3-bis(dimethylhydroxysilyl)-5-benzyloxybenzene (M1), catalyzed by 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidinium 2-ethylhexoate. M1 was prepared by the Grignard reaction using chlorodimethylsilane and 1,3-dibromo-5-benzyloxybenzene followed by the hydrolysis catalyzed by 5 % palladium on charcoal. M2 was prepared by deprotective hydrogenation of M1 catalyzed by 10 % palladium on charcoal. The obtained P1 was soluble in common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, dichloromethane, toluene, and so forth as well as in highly polar solvents as ethanol and methanol in which poly(tetramethyl-1,3-silphenylenesiloxane) is insoluble. The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of P1 was determined to be 40 °C from DSC, which was much higher than that of poly(tetramethyl-1,3-silphenylenesiloxane) (-52 °C), indicating that the intermolecular and/or intramolecular hydrogen bondings based on hydroxyl groups restricted the mobility of the main chain. The temperature at 5 % weight loss (T_{d5}) of P1 (393 °C) determined by TG was lower than that of poly(tetramethyl-1,3-silphenylenesiloxane) (ca. 500 °C), indicating that the phenol moieties decline the thermal stability; however, the obtained P1 would promise to be a new reactive-polymer with phenolic-hydroxyl moieties to develop new functional materials.\n",

The syntheses were accomplished in two stages: (1) the preparation of the first (or inner) block fitted with appropriate chlorine termini capable of initiating the polymerization of the second (or outer) block with TiCl_{4} and (2) the mediation of the polymerization of the second block. Therefore, the synthesis of tCum(PIB-b-PNBD)_{3} was effected with tCum(PIB-Cl^{t})_{3} [where Cl^{t} is tert-chlorine and number-average molecular weight (M_{n}) = 102000 g/mol] by the use of TiCl_{4} and 30/70 CH_{3}Cl/CHCl_{3} solvent mixtures at -35 °C. PNBD homopolymer contamination formed by chain transfer was removed by selective precipitation. According to gel permeation chromatography, the M_{n}'s of the star blocks were 107300-109200 g/mol. NMR spectroscopy (750 MHz) was used to determine structures and molecular weights. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated two glass-transition temperatures (T_{g}'s), one each for the PIB (-65 °C) and PNBD (232 °C) phases. Thermogravimetric analysis thermograms showed 5 % weight losses at 293 °C in air and at 352 °C in N_{2}.

Two synthetic methods for the control of the PAS sequence were used: a one-step synthesis that presumably gave PAS with a random sequence and the polymerization of 3,4'-DAPE with a presynthesized dimer, IPC-PDMS-IPC (two-step synthesis), that presumably gave PAS with an alternating sequence of 3,4'-DAPE and PDMS segments. In a ^{1}H NMR study of the amide protons of the 3,4'-DAPE component in PAS, the relative length of the 3,4'-DAPE segment of randomly sequenced PAS to that of ideally sequenced PAS could be estimated. The glass-transition temperatures of the 3,4'-DAPE and PDMS segments of random PAS were 152-234 and -104 to -117 °C, respectively, whereas the alternating PAS sequences showed no glass transition for the 3,4'-DAPE segments. A tensile test indicated that randomly sequenced PAS behaved like a rubber-toughened material at lower PDMS contents and like a thermoplastic elastomer at higher PDMS contents, whereas the alternately sequenced PAS behaved like a very soft rubber, showing a high value of elongation at the breaking point.\n",

Coordination of PHEN with active Zinc center enhanced the nucleophilic ability of the metal carbonate, which became more regio-specific in attacking carbon in PO, leading to PPC with improved H-T linkages. Moreover, the binding of PHEN to active Zinc center also raised the carbonate content of PPC to over 99 %, whereas the PPC from common rare earth ternary catalyst was about 96 %. Unlike the highly regio-regular structure PPC but with relatively low molecular weight recently reported in the literature, our high molecular weight regio-regular PPC did show significant improvement in thermal and mechanical performances.

Differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray observations of PET and PC samples coalesced from their crystalline γ-CD-ICs suggest structures and morphologies that are different from those of samples obtained by ordinary solution and melt processing techniques. For example, as-received PC is generally amorphous with a glass-transition temperature (T_{g}) of about 150 °C; when cast from tetrahydrofuran solutions, PC is semicrystalline with a melting temperature (T_{m}) of about 230 °C; and after PC/γ-CD-IC is washed with hot water for the removal of the host γ-CD and for the coalescence of the guest PC chains, it is semicrystalline but has an elevated T_{m} value of about 245 °C. PC crystals formed upon the coalescence of highly extended and segregated PC chains from the narrow channels in the γ-CD host lattice are possibly more chain-extended and certainly more stable than chain-folded PC crystals grown from solution. Melting the PC crystals formed by coalescence from PC/γ-CD-IC produces a normal amorphous PC melt that, upon cooling, results in typical glassy PC. PET coalesced from its γ-CD-IC crystals, although also semicrystalline, displays a T_{m} value only marginally elevated from that of typical bulk or solution-crystallized PET samples. However, after the melting of γ-CD-IC-coalesced PET crystals, it is difficult to quench the resultant PET melt into the usual amorphous PET glass, characterized by a T_{g} value of about 80 °C. Instead, the coalesced PET melt rapidly recrystallizes during the attempted quench, and so upon reheating, it displays neither a T_{g} nor a crystallization exotherm but simply remelts at the as-coalesced T_{m}. This behavior is unaffected by the coalesced PET sample being held above T_{m} for 2 h, indicating that the extended, unentangled nature of the chains in the noncrystalline regions of the coalesced PET are not easily converted into the completely disordered, randomly coiled, entangled melt. Apparently, the highly extended, unentangled characters of the PC and PET chains in their γ-CD-ICs are at least partially retained after they are coalesced.

From these hybrid latexes, clear yellowish films were obtained with two glass transitions: one close to that of polybutylacrylate (T_{g} = -50 °C) and the second between 15 and 40 °C, depending on PI concentration. PI causes a reinforcement of the mechanical properties at room temperature. This reinforcement is enhanced through an appropriate thermal treatment.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), coming from renewable resources, can be used to solve environmental problems. However, PLA has to have a relatively high molecular weight in order to have acceptable mechanical properties as required in many applications. Chain-extension reaction is an effective method to raise the molecular weight of PLA. RESULTS: A high molecular weight biodegradable lactic acid polymer was successfully synthesized in two steps. First, the lactic acid monomer was oligomerized to low molecular weight hydroxyl-terminated prepolymer; the molecular weight was then increased by chain extension using 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate as the chain extender. The polymer was characterized using ^{1}H NMR analysis, gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that the obtained polymer had a M_{n} of 27 500 g mol^{-1} and a M_{w} of 116 900 g mol^{-1} after 40 min of chain extension at 180 °C. The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of the low molecular weight prepolymer was 47.8 °C. After chain extension, T_{g} increased to 53.2 °C. The mechanical and rheological properties of the obtained polymer were also investigated. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that high molecular weight PLA can be achieved by chain extension to meet conventional uses.\n",

Optical properties showed that PLA nanocomposites have monodispersed Ag-NPs due to the intense SPR (surface plasmon resonance) absorption band at 414 nm, with a calculated particle size of ~30 nm. The crystallinity is gradually raised at a maximum level (21.1 %) compared to the pure PLA (2.3 %) and T_{g} drastically decreased from 61 to 36.8 °C when Ag-NPs are incorporated in the plasticized PLA matrix. These results were consistent with the enhanced elastic modulus in DMA analysis, explained from the viewpoint of a good nanofiller dispersion and crystallization behavior, providing a stable and ordered crystal (α-form) in agreement with FTIR and DSC analysis. Finally, the outcomes indicate a synergistic effect between Ag-NPs and the plasticizer GTA, due to the nucleating effect of the monodispersed Ag-NPs and the mobility chain promoted by the plasticizer in the macromolecular arrangement of the PLA.\n",

Herein, we report a reinforced PLA-based elastomer material prepared by physical blending with different weight ratios of polyamide elastomer (PAE). After the modification, PLA/PAE elastomers show excellent shape recovery (> 99 %) from ~ 25 to ~ 70 °C and toughness (impact strength ~ 50 kJ/m^{2}). By regulating the weight ratio of PAE at 10 wt %, the resulting PLA/PAE elastomers showed relative low glass transition temperature (T_{g}) at ~ 61 °C versus pure PLA (~ 65 °C). Besides, the storage modulus (E') decreased to ~ 8000 MPa (at 10 wt % PAE) indicated that PAE weakened the PLA crystallinity and promoted its toughness. Comparing with pure PLA, PLA/PAE elastomers showed almost 45 % decrease on loss modulus (E''), which indicated that elasticity and shape recovery behavior have been promoted. With the increase of PAE ratio in PLA/PAE elastomers, the initial recovery temperature of blends showed decreasing trend, which indicated that blends are more helpful for shape recovery actuated by temperature. This work provided a new PLA/PAE elastomer with stronger toughness and faster thermo-induced shape recovery that may show great potential for fundamental research and biomedical applications.\n",

The results showed that thermal decomposition temperature of the beads was raised with increased crosslinking in the porous beads, suggesting that their thermal stability could be greatly improved by crosslinking as expected. DSC analysis revealed that porous beads with crosslinking degrees less than 30 % (in weight) had a glass transition and that its temperature (T_{g}) was gradually changed from about 100 °C (T_{g} of linear polystyrene) to 160 °C as the crosslinking was increased. However, T_{g} disappeared and an exothermic peak around 165 °C was found for highly crosslinked beads with more than 30 % of crosslinking. The exothermic peak might be attributed to the coupling reaction and/or thermal polymerization of pendant double bonds at high temperature as proved by IR and Raman spectra. When crosslinking was less than 10 %, a melting process could be observed as an endotherm at about 270 °C. Otherwise, if the crosslinking was above 15 %, no melting was displayed and instead of it an exothermic phenomenon took place between 250-350 °C.

Thermal stability and mechanical properties increased with counter-ion type in the following order: sPP2.5-Cs^{+} < sPP2.5-Na^{+} < sPP2.5^{-}Mg^{2+}. However, decreased thermal stability and physical properties were observed using Al^{3+} as a counter-ion (sPP2.5-Al^{3+}). He, H_{2}, CO_{2}, N_{2}, O_{2} and CH_{4} permeability decreased within sPP2.5-M based upon counter-ion type, size, and valence. Larger CO_{2} and H_{2} molecules were more permeable than He, which revealed a more complex transport process was occurring within sPP2.5. Metal-ion complexation with sPP2.5 significantly reduced CO_{2} and H_{2} permeability. PP possessed high CO_{2} permeability (152 Barrers) with moderate CO_{2}/CH_{4} selectivity (12.6). sPP2.5-Na^{+} (IEC = 2.5 meq/g) had a CO_{2}/CH_{4} selectivity of 71.3, and counter-ion substitution to create sPP2.5-Cs^{+} increased CO_{2}/CH_{4} selectivity by_{2}3 %. Gas solubility and diffusivity decreased with increasing IEC and metal-ion complexation strength. sPPx-M had tunable ideal gas permselectivity that was largely a function of sulfonate group concentration and counter-ion type.\n",

The SEM analysis revealed that PLA with 10 wt % HL appeared uniform with extra small bumps, confirmed the interaction between PLA and HL. The thermal analysis revealed a glass transition temperature of 57.4 °C for neat PLA film, but the addition of HL elicited a decrease in the temperature of the peak (43.8 °C). The incorporation of plasticizer into PLA resulted in the increase of elongation at break, as well as the decrease of tensile strength and tensile modulus. Even though a decrease in transparency was recorded, the PLA/HL blend films appeared transparent by visually observation. The water vapor permeability of PLA/HL blend films increased with the increase of HL. The PLA/HL blend films could effectively extend the shelf-life of fresh-cut pears as the commercial low density polyethylene films. The results indicated that the properties of PLA films can be modified with the addition of HL and PLA/HL blend films could serve as an alternative as food packaging materials to reduce environmental problems associated with synthetic packaging films.\n",

      "isotactic-Polypropylene (PP) composites reinforced with 20, 45, and 60 wt % fly ash (FA) were prepared by injection molding at 483 K. The thermo-mechanical and morphological behaviors of PP and composites were examined. The addition of FA led to significant enhancement of both storage (E') and loss modulus (E'') of the composites compared to those of PP at a given temperature, supporting the view of the formation of an interfacial interaction between the surfaces of PP and FA. By increasing the temperature from 303 to 423 K, these properties decreased exponentially, and indicated the temperature-activated mobility of segmental chains of PP. The tangent δ curves of PP and composites showed broader patterns. The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) was assigned at 343 K for PP and 245-246 K for the composites. In the theoretical calculation of the storage modulus and tangent δ, the modifications were required in the existing equations to fit the experimental data well. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a uniform distribution of spherical FA particles in the composites. The calculated interfacial interaction between the FA and PP surfaces was 1.85, which is similar with other composite systems.\n",

The conversion of epoxides dramatically increased up to 89.7 % (yield: 384.2 g of polymer per g of Zn) with increasing reaction temperature from 60 °C to 80 °C. The optimized reaction temperature is 80 °C. The chemical structure, the molecular weight, as well as thermal and mechanical properties of the resulting terpolymers were investigated extensively. When CHO feed content (mol %) is lower than 10 %, the PPCHC terpolymers have number average molecular weight (M_{n}) ranging from 102 x 10^{3} to 202 x 10^{3} and molecular weight distribution (MWD) values ranging from 2.8 to 3.5. In contrast to poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC), the introduction of small amount of CHO leads to increase in the glass transition temperature from 38.0 °C to 42.6 °C. Similarly, the mechanical strength of the synthesized terpolymer is greatly enhanced due to the incorporation of CHO. These improvements in mechanical and thermal properties are of importance for the practical application of PPC.\n",

The as-synthesized polymers exhibit number-average molecular weights of 1.7 x 10^{4} for P1 and 2.1 x 10^{4} g/mol for P2. They emit strong one- and two-photon excitation fluorescence with the peak around 502 nm, and the fluorescence quantum yields around 0.76 in chloroform. In film state, P1 and P2 show different red-shift emission with the peaks at 512 nm and 523 nm, respectively. The DSC measurement reveals that as-synthesized polymers are all amorphous aggregates with the glass transition temperatures of 131 °C for P1 and 152 °C for P2. The solution two-photon absorption (TPA) properties of P1 and P2 in chloroform are measured by the two-photon-induced fluorescence method using femtosecond laser pulses (120 fs). The TPA cross sections (δ) are measured over the range of 700-900 nm. The maximal δ of P1 and P2 all appear at ~800 nm and are 1010 GM and 940 GM per repeating unit, respectively. This suggests that no notable interactions among structure units that impair their fluorescence and TPA properties, and the polymers with large δ can be obtained by using the high TPA-active units as building blocks.\n",

      "In this study, the mechanical and chemical properties of a series of sulfonated poly(styrene-isobutylene-styrene) (SIBS) block copolymers were evaluated using a combination of nanoindentation, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), elemental analysis (EA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), water absorption, and small angle X-ray scattering studies (SAXS). The materials properties were characterized as a function of the sulfonation percent in the block copolymers, as well as a result of the counter-ion substitution with Mg^{2+}, Ca^{2+}, and Ba^{2+}. Nanoindentation studies revealed that the elastic modulus (E) and hardness (H) increase with sulfonation up to a certain level, at which point, the effect of water content further hinders any mechanical reinforcement. The incorporation of counter-ions increases E and H, but the results are dependent upon the size of the counter-ion. DMA results showed that the polymer maintained the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polyisobutylene (PIB) segment (-60 °C) regardless of the sulfonation level or counter-ion substituted. However, both the shoulder of the PIB Tg (-30 °C), which was probably caused by a Rouse-type motion, as well as the Tg of polystyrene (105 °C) disappeared upon sulfonation. Counter-ion substitution increased the storage modulus of the rubbery plateau, which is indicative of a stronger and more thermally stable crosslinked complex formation. Additional unique relaxations were observed with the counter-ions, and could be attributed to the stretching/rotation of the SO bond and the interaction of the cations with the oxygen in the sulfonic group. FTIR results also revealed a unique shifting of the asymmetric SO band when counter-ions were added.\n",

The obtained high-molecular-weight polymers showed elastomeric or plastic properties. Generally, the PTMO-based polymers exhibited significantly lower glass-transition temperatures (up to -48.1 vs -1.4 °C), a higher degree of microphase separation, and ordering in hard-segment domains in comparison with the corresponding PHCD-based ones. Moreover, it was observed that the polymers with the PTMO soft segments showed poorer tensile strengths (up to 36.5 vs 59.6 MPa) but higher elongations at break.

Degradation studies were performed with and without applied cyclical stress, and in most cases, elastic modulus decrease and mass loss occurred steadily over a 24-h period. Unexpected partial crystallization was discovered to occur in the networks containing higher molecular weight PEGDA in the presence of humidity and high frequency cyclic loading. In all materials, high frequency applied cyclic loading during in situ degradation resulted in catastrophic fracture of the material prior to an appreciable decrease in modulus.\n",

Addition of salt from 10 to 45 wt % LiTf resulted in an increase in the mean free volume cavity size at room temperature (r.t.) as measured by the orthoPositronium (oPs) pickoff lifetime, τ_{3}, with little change in relative concentration of free volume sites as measured by oPs pickoff intensity, I_{3}. The region from 45 to 66 wt % salt displayed no variation in relative free volume cavity size and concentration. This salt concentration range (45 wt %<[LiTf]<66 wt %) corresponds to a region of high ionic conductivity of order 10^{-5} to 10^{-6} S cm^{-1} at T_{g} as measured by PALS. A percolation phenomenon is postulated to describe conduction in this composition region. Salt addition was shown to lower the T_{g} as measured by PALS; T_{g} was 115 °C for PAN and 85 °C for PAN/66 wt % LiTf. The T_{g} and free volume behaviour of this polymer-in-salt electrolyte (PISE) was compared to a poly(ether urethane)/LiClO_{4} where the polymer is the major component, ie traditional solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). In contrast to the PISE, the T_{g} of the SPE was shown to increase with increasing salt concentration from 5.3 to 15.9 wt %. The relative free volume cavity size and concentration at r.t. were shown to decrease with increasing salt concentration. Ionic conductivity in this SPE was of order 10^{-5} S cm^{-1} at r.t., which is over 60 °C above T_{g}, 10^{-8} S cm^{-1} at 25 °C above T_{g}, and conductivity was not measurable at T_{g}.\n",

      "Polymers with eugenol moieties covalently bonded to the macromolecular chains were synthesized for potential application in orthopedic and dental cements. First, eugenol was functionalized with polymerizable groups. The synthetic methods employed afforded two different methacrylic derivatives, where the acrylic and eugenol moieties were either directly bonded, eugenyl methacrylate (EgMA), or separated through an oxyethylene group, ethoxyeugenyl methacrylate (EEgMA). A typical Fisher esterification reaction was used for the synthesis of EgMA and EEgMA, affording the desired monomers in 80 % yields. Polymerization of each of the novel monomers, at low conversion, provided soluble polymers consisting of hydrocarbon macromolecules with pendant eugenol moieties. At high conversions only cross-linked polymers were obtained, attributed to participation of the allylic double bonds in the polymerization reaction. In addition, copolymers of each eugenol derivative with ethyl methacrylate (EMA) were prepared at low conversion, with the copolymerization reaction studied by assuming the terminal model and the reactivity ratios determined according to linear and nonlinear methods. The values obtained were r_{EgMA} = 1.48, r_{EMA} = 0.55 and r_{EEgMA} = 1.22, r_{EMA} = 0.42. High molecular weight polymers and copolymers were obtained at low conversion. Analysis of thermal properties revealed a T_{g} of 95 °C for PEgMA and of 20 °C for PEEgMA and an increase in the thermal stability for the eugenol derivatives polymers and copolymers with respect to that of PEMA. Water sorption of the copolymers was found to decrease with the eugenol derivative content. Both monomers EgMA and EEgMA showed antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, producing inhibition halos of 7 and 21 mm, respectively. Finally, cell culture studies revealed that the copolymers did not leach any toxic eluants and showed good cellular proliferation with respect to PEMA. This study thus indicates that the eugenyl methacrylate derivatives are potentially good candidates for dental and orthopedic cements.\n",

In this study, the PEN films prepared by the tape-casting formed the thermally stable triazine rings by catalytic cross-linking reaction gradually, which was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The chemical cross-linking reaction occurred as the CN group absorption of PEN at 2221 cm^{-1} decreased and a new absorption peak, at 1682 cm^{-1}, was observed, and the absorption peak intensity would be progressively larger, with the extension of the processing time. After the formation of cross-linking networks, the cross-linking degree and thermal and mechanical properties of the processed films were improved substantially, compared with the untreated films. The film with added ZnCl_{2} as the catalyst was more rapidly cross-linked, and its properties were better than that without catalyst at the same treatment conditions. The glass-transition temperature (T_{g}) of PEN films processed at 350 °C for 4 h (213.65 °C) was higher than that of PEN films before the treatment (161 °C), and the tensile strength was also improved significantly.

      "We report here the swelling and relaxation properties of confined poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) films having thicknesses of less than 70 nm under supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO_{2}) using the X-ray reflectivity technique. Swellability is found to be dominant in thinner films compared to thicker ones as a consequence of the confinement-induced densification of the former. Swellability is proportionately increased with the density of the film. PBMA films exhibit a more significant swelling than do PS films, and their differences become more prominent with the increase in film thickness. A comparison between the results obtained for polystyrene (PS) and PBMA ultrathin films reveals that the swellability is dependent upon the specific intermolecular interaction between CO_{2} and the chemical groups available in the polymers. Owing to strong Lewis acid-base interactions with scCO_{2} and the lower glass-transition temperature (bulk T_{g} ≈ 29 °C), PBMA films exhibit a greater amount of swelling than do PS films (bulk T_{g} ≈ 100 °C). Though they reach to the different swollen state upon exposition, identical relaxation behavior as a function of aging time is evidenced. This unprecedented behavior can be ascribed to the strong bonding between trapped CO_{2} and PBMA that probably impedes the release of CO_{2} molecules from the swollen PBMA films manifested in suppressed relaxation.\n",

Nevertheless, traditional polymer processing always involves high temperature and multiple processing, which result in property deterioration, low recycling ability and high energy consumption. Herein, we synthesized a poly(n-butyl acrylate)@polystyrene (PBA@PS) core-shell polymer with a low glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of -40 °C for the PBA component and a high T_{g} of 109 °C for the PS component. This core-shell polymer is a typical baroplastic, which was employed as a composite matrix. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) were introduced into PBA@PS to develop a highly conductive CNT/PBA@PS composite for efficient electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding application. As a result of the semi-solid melting mechanism of PBA@PS, the CNT/PBA@PS composite was facilely processed at room temperature (25 °C), and interestingly, the composite established a typical segregated structure. The segregated CNT networks endowed the composite with a high EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 45.1 dB at 5.0 wt % CNT loading. More importantly, the composite exhibited outstanding repeatability and durability after multiple processing, in sharp contrast to conventional polymer composites. Its mechanical properties after 10-cycle remolding were almost identical to the first-molded specimens, and meanwhile, the EMI SE retention of 62.5 % was achieved, which is much higher than that of conventional polymer composites.

SEM results revealed uniformly dispersed graphite and MgO flakes in a PVC matrix and the successful formation of a thermal network by MA, which led to enhanced thermal conductivity.

      "To break through the industrial development bottlenecks of anionic polymerization in the field of polar monomers, poly n-hexyl methacrylate (PHMA) was prepared at 0 °C, 30 °C, and 60 °C with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) as the initiator in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and the conversions were almost complete. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis of poly n-hexyl methacrylate indicated that t-BuOK existed in numerous states when dissolved in THF, including different types of association and ion-pairs. A series of block copolymers of n-hexyl methacrylate (n-HMA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA), PMMA-b-PHMA (M_{n} 8200-16200) and PHMA-b-PMMA (M_{n} 19100-9500) were synthesized at 0 °C, and conversions were close to 100 %. The results of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) indicated that there were two glass transition temperatures, -10 to 0 °C for the PHMA block and 100 to 110 °C for the PMMA block. Furthermore, the competing behaviors of n-HMA and MMA in copolymerization were investigated by one-shot feeding of two types of monomers at 0 °C, 30 °C, and 60 °C. The kinetics curves and ^{13}C-NMR analysis of the copolymers indicated that the polymerization of n-HMA in the copolymerization was significantly dominant over that of MMA at set temperatures. The results in this study provided the possibility to realize anionic polymerization of methacrylate esters on a commercial scale.\n",

The properties of interest predicted by the molecular dynamics method were density, free volume, specific volume, radial distribution function, non-bond energy, torsion energy, mean squared displacement and modulus. The T_{g} of the polyethylene unit cell were determined by means of analyzing these properties. The simulated value of the T_{g} is about 200 K, which is in good agreement with available data of 195 K in the literature.

Above T_{g}, main chain segmental motions (α relaxation) were detected and characterized using both DS and FFC NMR relaxometry. The correlation times extracted by the analysis of DS and FFC NMR relaxometry data agreed within a factor of three and showed a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann temperature dependence, with an associated T_{g} of 69 °C and a fragility of 155 for PVB glass. Below T_{g}, a secondary process (β relaxation) was revealed by DS, and was ascribed to reorientations of the vinyl alcohol dipoles due to local twisting motions with an associated activation barrier of 11 kcal mol^{-1}. The β process was also found to contribute to ^{1}H NMR relaxation above T_{g}.\n",

The size and morphology of the synthesized NPs have been confirmed by high-resolution transition electron microscopy (HRTEM), and results indicate the size of the particles is around 8-14 nm with spherical in shape. A series of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposites (NCs) have been fabricated with varying amounts viz, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 wt % of AgAlO_{2} NPs using solvent intercalation technique. The intensity of crystalline peaks of NC films was reduced, and a slight shift in the peak position was observed in XRD profiles, which depicts the changes in microcrystalline behaviors of the NCs. The morphological behaviors of PVA/AgAlO_{2} films have been established by scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy. The physical interactions between the components in NCs have been evaluated by Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimeter data showed a reduction in glass transition temperature (T_{g}) from 72 °C for PVA to 64 °C for PVA/2.5 wt % NPs. The optical constants of NCs have been evaluated from UV-Visible spectra. The obtained results reveal that band gap energy (E_{g}) reduces from 4.9 to 2.8 eV and refractive index increases from 1.5 to 2.4 with an increase in AgAlO_{2} NPs content from 0 to 2.5 wt % in PVA matrix respectively.

Five different copolymerizations, with molar feed ratios of 1,4-butanediol to sugar-based diols of 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40 and 50:50, were carried out for each bicyclic diol in order to make a comparative study on their reactivity and properties of the resulting copolyesters. Molecular weights and compositions data of the copolyesters revealed the greater facility of diacetalized diols to react under these conditions compared to isosorbide. The three bicyclic diols contributed to increase the thermal stability and also the glass-transition temperature of PBT. The replacement of 40 % of 1,4-butanediol by sugar-based diols increased the glass transition temperature of PBT from 31 °C to ~60 °C in the case of Galx and up to ~90 °C regarding Is and Manx.

The PEEK-NCO polymers were then reacted with diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) to form copolymers containing varying proportions of thermoplastic PEEK segments linked to DGEBA through urethane bridges. Room temperature curable, tough adhesive formulations were processed using these copolymers along with triethylenetetramine (TETA) as the curing agent. Complex viscosity, gelation time, storage modulus and loss modulus of the adhesive formulations were evaluated under isothermal conditions. Adhesive strength of the formulations was evaluated on aluminium substrates at 25 °C, 100 °C and -196 °C and the results were correlated to the composition. Cured adhesive samples were cryogenically fractured and the fracture morphologies were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis was performed to understand the visco-elastic properties of the cured adhesive formulations. The PEEK- modified epoxy adhesive systems exhibited enhanced glass transition temperatures in the range of 88-90 °C vis a vis the unmodified epoxy (80 °C) and offered a broad service temperature capability from -196 °C to 100 °C.\n",

Thermal properties of the resulting biopolyesters are directly related to the length of the aliphatic chain of the diacid.

Effect of GNP content on the viscoelastic behavior and thermomechanical properties of composites was studied via rheometer, scanning electron microscope (SEM), infrared thermal imaging (ITI) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), etc According to dynamical rheological testing, thermorheological complexity was clearly displayed at elevated GNP content, based upon flow activation energy (E_{a}) and time-temperature superposition (TTS) principle. The infrared thermal imaging (ITI) indicated that a filler conductive network was gradually formed with increasing filler content. The average heating rate of the samples increased from 0.74 to 0.92 °C/s. The Agari model was found to fairly interpret the variation of thermal conductivity as a function of GNP loading, which agreed well with SEM observation and indicative of the formation of a GNP network structure. Dynamic thermomechanical properties of the composites were heavily influenced by the temperature distributions within the samples. The addition of GNP increased the glass transition temperature of PMMA from 116.7 to 125.9 °C, which favored enhanced thermophysical properties of PMMA. The prepared composites in this work showed wonderful mechanical properties even at relatively high temperatures (eg, having storage modulus of 1.3-1.9 GPa and yielding strength more than 58.0 MPa at 50 °C).

      "This study describes a detailed analytical characterization of polyaryletherketone (PAEK) polymers used in extrusion-based additive manufacturing. The results provide key observations and highlight differences between commercially available polymers of the PAEK family, specifically polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyetherketoneketone (PEKK). Results suggest that inherent differences in their molecular structure lead to notable differences in terms of their viscoelastic, thermal and physical properties. Similarly, direct comparison of the properties between parent filaments and three-dimensional printed (3DP) parts suggests that, as observed in subtractive processes, the molecular structure of the PAEK polymer selected (PEEK or PEKK), as well as the inherent physical properties associated with it, determine greatly the performance of final 3DP parts. Differential scanning calorimetry results suggest that the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of PEEK 3DP bars (146.8 °C) is about 8 °C lower than that of the parent PEEK filament (154.8 °C). These small differences manifest greatly in the viscoelastic response after T_{g}, and the temperature at which a decrease in storage modulus is observed occurs consistently at lower temperatures in 3DP PEEK bars (ca 130 °C) compared to PEEK filaments (ca 150 °C). In contrast, no observable differences are noted between parent filaments and 3DP bars in PEKK polymers. For these polymers, the inherent semi-crystalline behavior dominates their thermal and viscoelastic response. These structure-property relationships provide fundamental understanding to aid in the design and manufacturing of several industrial and biomedical applications that could potentially leverage the advantages of high-temperature thermoplastic PAEK resins, as well as in the incorporation of these polymers in a growing number of technologies encompassing the field of additive manufacturing.\n",

Treatment of cis-pBD (M_{n} = 160 kDa) with an N,N'-diamidocarbene afforded a polycyclopropanated intermediate that was subsequently hydrolyzed (M_{n} = 198 kDa). Catalytic hydrogenation of the resultant poly(butadiene-co-(ethylene-alt-acrylic acid)) (pBDEAA) generated a pEAA that contained 15 mol % of acrylic acid and was isolated in up to 75 % overall yield from the cis-pBD starting material. Thermal analysis revealed that the pEAA displayed an increased glass transition temperature (T_{g} = -10 °C) and melting temperature (T_{m} = 80 °C) with respect to its poly(butadiene) precursor (T_{g} = -108 °C; T_{m} = 10 °C). Likewise, when compared to a poly(ethylene) homopolymer prepared by hydrogenating the cis-pBD starting material (H_{2}-pBD), the pEAA exhibited increased tensile strength (2.61-3.97 MPa for pEAA vs. 0.91-1.46 MPa for H_{2}-pBD) and elongation (223-507 % for pEAA vs. 12-30 % for H_{2}-pBD) but a reduced storage modulus (200 MPa for pEAA vs. 801 MPa for H_{2}-pBA), as determined by dynamic mechanical analysis.

Among the mechanical properties of these thin films determined by bulge testing and tensile testing, the SBS thin films exhibited a much lower elastic modulus (ca. 0.045 GPa, 212 nm thickness) in comparison with the PS thin films (ca. 1.19 GPa, 217 nm thickness). The lower elastic modulus and lower thickness of the SBS thin films resulted in higher conformability and thus higher strength of adhesion to an uneven surface such as an artificial skin model with roughness (R_{a} = 10.6 μm), even though they both have similar surface energies. By analyzing the mechanical properties of the SBS thin films, the elastic modulus and thickness of the thin films were strongly correlated with their conformability to a rough surface, which thus led to a high adhesive strength. Therefore, the SBS thin films will be useful as coating layers for a variety of materials.\n",

The top surface Bromo moieties of the PETg were activated as ATRP macro-intiator to polymerize Butyl Acrylate (BuA) and styrenic azobenzene (SA) monomer. In the meantime, a serial of statistical copolymers was synthetized based on SA and BuA units to finely tuned the glass transition temperature value of copolymer close to the room temperature. The introduction of the BuA unit decreased the initial Tg value of the PSA from 100 to -10 °C.

The results reveal that a processing window of the BA-a/PU mixtures is widened with the increasing urethane prepolymer fraction, that is, the liquefying temperature is lowered and the gel point shifted to higher temperature with the amount of the PU.

      "The relative permittivity and breakdown have been measured for commercial polycarbonate (comm-BPA-PC), purified commercial polycarbonate (rp-BPA-PC), and two new polycarbonates having low MCSAs (TriBPA-PC and TABPA-BPA-PC). Each of the new materials has a glass transition temperature, T_{g}, that is much higher than that of either the comm-BPA-PC or the rp-BPA-PC polycarbonate samples (187 and 191 °C vs. 148 °C). The relative permittivity measurements were carried out from 10 to 10^{5} Hz over a wide temperature range, and the results for the α- and γ-relaxation regions are reported. For the α-relaxation, the isochronal peak position, T_{α}, approximately scales with T_{g}. On the other hand, the peak position for the γ-relaxation is approximately constant, independent of T_{g}. Also, in contrast to what is observed for the α-relaxation, the γ-relaxation region exhibits a strong increase in peak height as temperature/frequency increases, and a significant difference is found between Arrhenius plots determined from isochronal and isothermal data analyses. The γ-relaxation region for comm-BPA-PC and associated activation parameters show strong history/purity effects. The activation parameters also depend upon the method of data analysis. The results shed light on discrepancies that exist in the literature for BPA-PC. The shapes of the γ loss peaks and hence glassy-state motions for all of the polymers are very similar, including the high-temperature shoulders that are ascribed by some investigators as due to cooperative motions within and between neighbor chains.The intensities of the TriBPA-PC and TABPA-BPA-PC γ peaks are reduced by an amount that closely matches the reduced volume fraction of carbonate units in the two new polymers. Finally, the dielectric breakdown data for comm-BPA-PC show that the breakdown strength is strongly affected by sample history, and this is assumed to be related to volatile components in the material. It is found that the breakdown strengths for TriBPA-PC and TABPA-BPA-PC are relatively close to that for rp-BPA-PC with the value for TriBPA-PC being slightly larger than that for rp-BPA-PC or the value usually reported for typical capacitor-grade polycarbonate. Finally, it is shown that the real part of the relative permittivity remains relatively constant from low temperatures to T_{g}. Consequently, based in the dielectric properties, TriBPA-PC and TABPA-BPA-PC should be usable in capacitors to at least 50 °C higher than BPA-PC.\n",

FTIR spectra and SEM images revealed that network structures between co-PI and AT are formed, which endowed the nanocomposites with outstanding thermal and mechanical properties.

      "Poly(arylene ether nitrile) (PEN) end-capped with phthalonitrile (PEN-n) was synthesized by incorporating phthalonitrile into the terminals of PEN. The as-prepared flexible PEN-n (after elevated temperature treatment) was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography, and rheological measurements. In addition, the effects of curing behaviors on properties of PEN-n films were studied by thermal, dielectric and mechanical measurements. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis showed that glass transition temperature of PEN-n was improved from 176 to 232 °C as the curing temperature and time increased. Thermal gravimetric analysis revealed that initial decomposition temperature of PEN-n cured at 320 °C for 2 h was 570 °C. Mechanical properties showed that tensile strength of PEN-n uncured and cured at 320 °C for 3 h was 85 and 97 MPa, respectively. The dielectric properties showed that the dielectric constant of PEN-n film decreased from 4.0 to 3.1 as the curing time increased and dielectric loss of PEN-n was 0.01 at 100 kHz. This kind of PEN-n film may be used as a good candidate for high-performance polymeric materials.\n",

Homo-networks were prepared by crosslinking 3-arm star-shaped PIBs fitted with terminal cyanoacrylate groups, [O(PIB-CA)_{3}], and co-networks by copolymerizing O(PIB-CA)_{3} with OctCA using N-dimethyl-p-toluidine (DMT). Neat O(PIB-CA)_{3}, and O(PIB-CA)_{3}/OctCA blends, upon contact with initiator, polymerize within seconds to optically transparent strong rubbery co-networks, O(PIB-CA)_{3}-co-P(OctCA). Homo- and co-network formation was demonstrated by sol/gel studies, and structures and properties were characterized by a battery of techniques. The T_{g} of P(OctCA) is 58 °C by DSC, and 75 °C by DMTA. Co-networks comprising 25 % O(PIB-CA)_{3} (M_{n} = 2400 g/mol) and 75 % P(OctCA) are stronger and more extensible than skin. Short and long term creep studies show co-networks exhibit high dimensional stability and <6 % creep strain at high loading. When deposited on porcine skin co-networks yield hermetically-adhering clear rubbery coatings. Strips of porcine skin coated with co-networks could be stretched and twisted without compromising membrane integrity. The co-network is nontoxic to L-929 mouse fibroblasts.\n",

Compared with the non-methyl-substituted PPQs derived from 1,4-bis (4-benzilyloxy)benzene (I) and 4,4' -bis(4-benzilyloxy)biphenyl (II), the obtained polymers exhibited better solubility. They were soluble not only in the common m-cresol and chloroform, but in polar aprotic solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP).

The PEN-t-Ph/1,3,5-Tri-(3,4-dicyanophenoxy) benzene (TPh) system was prepared by cure treatment. The phthalonitrile on PEN-t-Ph were thermally crosslinked with TPh in the presence of diamino diphenyl sulfone through cure treatment up to 280-340 °C, which led to the transformation from thermoplastic polymers to thermosetting polymers. This is because the phthalonitrile on the PEN-t-Ph can react with TPh by forming phthalocyanine ring. The glass transition temperatures of the PEN-t-Ph/TPh system increased from 152.4 °C to 194.7 °C, and the initial decomposition temperature (ranging from 475.3 °C to 544.0 °C) increased by 68 °C after thermal curing.

Two competitive reactions, ring-opening reaction of carboxylic group with oxetane group and esterification of carboxylic group with hydroxyl group, occurred synchronously during the polymerization. The results showed that the hyperbranched polyesters, poly(SA-EHO) and poly(SA-EHPO), were synthesized successfully when succinic anhydride (SA) was selected to react with 3-Ethyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)oxetane (EHO) and 3-ethyl-3-((4-hydroxymethyl)phenoxymethyl)oxetane (EHPO), respectively. The degree of branching was determined to be about 0.7 for poly(SA-EHO) from the ^{1}H NMR result, which was higher than those reported in literature, indicating that the esterification was dominant. The glass transition temperatures (T_{g})s were measured as -11.5 °C for poly(SA-EHO) and 14.3 °C for poly(SA-EHPO) by DSC. The number average molecular weights were 1914 g/mol and 2108 g/mol with the polydispersity indices of 2.39 and 2.28 for poly(SA-EHO) and poly(SA-EHPO), respectively. Both poly(SA-EHO) and poly(SA-EHPO) were added to bisphenol A epoxy resin, EP828, with different contents and cured under UV exposure. From the DMTA and tensile results, the UV cured poly(SA-EHPO) showed higher T_{g} and tensile strength compared with poly(SA-EHO) because of the existence of phenyl group in poly(SA-EHPO) chain. Moreover, both the T_{g}s and mechanical strength decreased, whereas the elongation percents at break increased with poly(SA-EHO) and poly(SA-EHPO) increased. This indicates that the flexibility of cured films was improved by the addition of poly(SA-EHO) and poly(SA-EHPO) in the formulations.\n",

The monomer reactivity ratios in the polymerization of HFIB with VPFB were r_{1} (HFIB) = 0, r_{2} (VPFB) = 0.373, and r_{1}r_{2} = 0.

In this study, amorphous poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (pPEGMA) and pPEGMA functionalized with sulfobetaine pendants (pMPS8) are synthesized, and subsequently formulated with LiPF_{6} to be assessed as solid polymer electrolytes (SPE). The polymer properties are investigated using Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). These experimental analyses are used to account for the effects of a methacrylate-type polymer as an alternative to improve Li^{+} mobility across the polymer, and synergic benefits of its functionalization with sulfobetaine groups. pPEGMA displayed a T_{g} around -49 °C, which increases in the presence of the lithium salt to -38 °C due to the interactions arising between Li^{+} ions and the polymer, as confirmed by XRD and FTIR characterizations. The ionic conductivity of the pPEGMA/LiPF_{6} system is 6.92 x 10^{-6} S cm^{-1}, which denotes a partial dissociation of LiPF_{6} as a result of the formation of ion pairs, detected by the structural characterization. The functionalization of pPEGMA is an efficient method to decrease the T_{g} down to -53 °C, suggesting that pMPS8 keeps amorphous pPEGMA matrix allowing mobility of polymer chains by the presence of the sulfobetaine pendants. Evidence of this behavior is determined with the chemical and structural evaluations, and clearly observed in the increase of ionic conductivity by two orders of magnitude. Although the T_{g} of the pMPS8/LiPF_{6} system considerably augments to -24 °C, its effects are negligible in ionic conductivity (3.22 x 10^{-5} S cm^{-1}), indicating that a relatively low stiff backbone arises in pMPS8 structures, which is not influenced by the presence of LiPF_{6} due to the strong charge delocalization generated by the sulfobetaine groups.\n",

Cyclopolymerization of 4,4-bis(vinyloxymethyl)cyclohexene (1), a divinyl ether with a cyclohexene group, was investigated with the hydrogen chloride/zinc chloride (HCl/ZnCl_{2}) initiating system in toluene at 0 °C. The reaction proceeded quantitatively to give soluble poly(1)s in organic solvents. The content of the unreacted vinyl groups in the produced polymers was less than ~3 mol %, and therefore, the degree of cyclization of the polymers was determined to be ~97 %. The number-average molecular weight (M_{n}) of the polymers increased in direct proportion to monomer conversion and further increased on addition of a fresh monomer feed to the almost completely polymerized reaction mixture, indicating that living cyclopolymerization of 1 occurred. The chain linking reactions among the formed living cyclopolymers with 1,4-bis(vinyloxy)cyclohexane (3) as a crosslinker in toluene at 0 °C produced core-crosslinked star-shaped cyclopoly(1)s [star-poly(1)s] in high yield (100 %).

Thermal properties strongly depend on molar composition. Melting temperatures are lower than 70 °C for compositions rich in H-units; T_{m} varies from about 140 to 180 °C for copolymers with high butylene terephthalate (BT) content. Crystal lattice structures shift from the crystal phase of poly(ω-hydroxytetradecanoate) (PH) to that of PBT with increasing BT copolymer content, while the minor component is trapped in the crystallizable domains as defects. The amorphous phase is homogeneous for all compositions and T_{g} increases from -21 °C (PH homopolymer) to 61 °C (PBT). Also, mechanical properties vary in a continuous way, according to copolymer composition. Therefore, the combination of aliphatic and aromatic units enables molecular design of partially biobased materials with adjustable thermal and physical-mechanical properties. Thus, by judicious selection of copolymer composition, material properties can be fine-tuned to attain the desired balance of material rigidity, ductility, melting point and biobased content.\n",

In order to trace the structural evolution process, the time-resolved infrared spectral measurements have been performed in the isothermal crystallization from the glass to α form and in the solvent-induced crystallization from the glass to δ form at the various temperatures. Absorbance of crystallization-sensitive infrared bands was plotted against time, from which the crystallization kinetics were analyzed on the basis of Avrami equation: X(t)=1-exp[-(kt)n] where X is a normalized crystallinity, n is an index, k is a rate constant, and t is a time. The isothermal crystallization was investigated also by carrying out the temperature jump experiment of DSC thermograms, giving almost the same results as the infrared spectral measurements. The Avrami index n was 2-5 depending on the crystallization temperature (T_{c}). The k was also dependent on the T_{c}, about 10^{-1}-10^{-4} s^{-1} and could be fitted reasonably by the equation of crystallization kinetics. An extrapolation of the k vs T_{c} plot to the negligibly small k value allowed us to predict the temperature at which no crystallization should occur, ca. 100 °C, in good agreement with the observed T_{g} value. On the other hand, the solvent-induced crystallization was investigated for the first time at the various temperatures from 50 to 9 °C by the time-resolved measurement of infrared spectra. Compared with the experiment at room temperature, the crystallization was highly accelerated at 40-50 °C, while the crystallization rate was reduced remarkably at such a low temperature as 9 °C. The time dependence of infrared absorbance was analyzed for the crystallization-sensitive bands on the basis of Avrami equation as the first approximation, although the crystallization mechanism was more complicated than the isothermal crystallization case. The logarithm of the k value was found to change almost linearly with temperature and an extrapolation to infinitesimally small k value gave a T_{g} of about -15 °C. That is to say, the glass transition temperature was estimated to shift remarkably from 100 to -15 °C by absorbing solvent molecules or by a plasticizing effect.\n",

Unlike reactions run with a labile hexafunctional Fe initiator, reactions wherein MWs > 100K and degrees of polymerization (dp) >200 are attainable, Ru-centered polymers reach an upper MW limit of ~25K regardless of the number of functionalities on the initiator (difunctional, dp = ~125; tetrafunctional, dp = ~63; hexafunctional, dp = ~42 per initiator site). High monomer loadings and concentrations and elevated reaction temperatures were explored to surmount this barrier, and control experiments using different combinations of components found in typical Ru reaction mixtures are also described. Though M_{n} vs percent conversion plots are roughly linear for the Ru initiators, observed MWs are lower than expected values based on monomer/initiator loading. This may be due to poor correlation of polyoxazolines with linear PMMA standards and/or to competing chain transfer side reactions during the polymerization. Linear first-order kinetics plots were obtained. Comparison of rate constants obtained from the slopes of these plots reveals the trend expected for the targeted structures: hexa > tetra > di.\n",

Thin films of the insoluble BDMCyS-PPV and BDMPS-PPV were fabricated from soluble polymer precursor materials by thermal conversion, and the electronic properties of these films were investigated. Monosilyl-substituted DMCyS-PPV and DMPS-PPV exhibited good solubility in the conjugated state, good film-forming properties, and high molecular weights. Moreover, they showed better thermal stability and higher values of T_{g} (DMCyS-PPV, 125 °C; DMPS-PPV, 127 °C) than other PPV derivatives including alkylsilyl-substituted PPVs; this improved mechanical stability led to good electroluminescence performance. Monocyclohexylsilyl- or phenylsilyl-substituted DMCyS-PPV and DMPS-PPV exhibited sharp PL emissions at about 511 and 513 nm, respectively, along with extremely high photoluminescence (PL) efficiencies in both solution and film (DMCyS-PPV, Φ_{film} = 0.83; DMCPS-PPV, Φ_{film} = 0.82). LED devices fabricated from DMCyS-PPV and DMPS-PPV using the configuration ITO/polymer/Al showed electroluminescence (EL) maxima at 510 and 515 nm, respectively, with external EL quantum efficiencies of 0.02 % and 0.03 %. Incorporation of PVK as a hole-transporting layer between the ITO and polymer with an air-stable aluminium cathode caused a substantial improvement in the EL quantum efficiencies, increasing the values to 0.07 % for DMCyS-PPV and 0.08 % for DMPS-PPV.\n",

Poly(1)s possessing predicted molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions (MWD, M_{w}M_{n} < 1.1) were quantitatively obtained at -78 to -40 °C within 72 h. The stability of the propagating chain end of poly(1) was confirmed by the quantitative initiation efficiency in the postpolymerization. In the polymerizations initiated with DMPLi/LiCl at the various temperature ranging from -40 to -60 °C, the relationship of time-conversion was obtained from the GLC analysis of the residual monomer. The apparent rate constant and the activation energy of the anionic polymerization for 1 were determined as follows: ln= -5.85 x 10^{3}T + 23.3 L mol^{-1} s^{-1} and 49 ± 4 kJ mol^{-1}, respectively. N-Acryloyl-2-methylaziridine (2) also underwent the anionic polymerization initiated with DMPLi/LiCl at -78 °C to give the well-defined polymer. The radical polymerizations of 1 and 2 with AIBN proceeded in 77 and 100 % conversions, respectively. Poly(1) and poly(2) showed the glass transition temperatures at 98 and 54 °C but gave the insoluble products at higher temperatures around 150 °C through the thermal cross-linking of highly strained N-acylaziridines. The ring-opening and/or the substitution reactions of aziridine moieties of poly(1) and poly(2) also occurred with nucleophiles such as lithium methoxide and sodium salts of di(ethylene glycol).\n",

      "Six new copolymers of 9,9'-dioctylfluorene and 2,3-bis(p-phenylene)quinoxaline were synthesized, characterized, and used as blue-emitting materials in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The glass transition temperature increased from 67 °C in poly(9,9'-dioctylfluorene) (PFO) to as high as 160 °C in the alternating copolymer. All the copolymers emitted blue light in dilute toluene solution (417-423 nm), with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields that decreased from 72 % to 26 % with increasing quinoxaline content, and as thin films (429-439 nm). The PL lifetimes of solutions and thin films were 308-617 ps. Blue electroluminescence with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.16, 0.06) was achieved. Luminances of 240-520 cd/m^{2} varied with the quinoxaline content. External quantum efficiencies of up to 1 % at brightnesses of over 100 cd/m^{2} were obtained. Enhancement in LED performance by factors of 3-6 compared to that of PFO was achieved in a copolymer containing 5 mol % 2,3-bis(p-phenylene)quinoxaline. Significant enhancements in LED brightness and external quantum efficiency by factors of up to 120 were observed in copolymers containing 15-50 mol % 2,3-bis(p-phenylene)quinoxaline when using bilayer LiF/Al cathodes instead of Al. These results demonstrate that composition can be used to optimize the light-emitting properties of electroluminescent copolymers and that the fluorene-quinoxaline copolymers are useful materials for developing stable blue LEDs.\n",

The 2-(2-phenoxyethoxy)ethoxy side groups increased the T_{g} values of both the solid polyphosphazenes and the gel electrolytes relative to the control polymer poly[bis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)phosphazene] (MEEP) but decreased the ionic conductivity. Specifically, as the content of 2-(2-phenoxyethoxy)ethoxy side groups increased, the glass transition temperatures (T_{g}) also increased, from -79 °C for MEEP to -21 °C for poly[bis(2-(2-phenoxyethoxy)ethoxy)phosphazene]. A gel polymer electrolyte derived from MEEP had an ionic conductivity of 3.9 x 10^{-4} S/cm at 25 °C, one of the highest measured for a MEEP-type system. The gel electrolyte derived from the polymer with all phenyl-terminated substituents had an ionic conductivity of 1.8 x 10^{-5} S/cm at 25 °C, and those from mixed-substituent polymers increased with increasing 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy side group content. The gel electrolyte derived from a polymer with a 60:40 ratio of 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy to 2-(2-phenoxyethoxy)ethoxy side groups gave the best compromise between dimensional stability and conductivity, with a T_{g} of -61 °C and an ionic conductivity of 1.2 x 10^{-4} S/cm.\n",

We employed positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) to investigate the free volume. From the lifetime spectra analyzed with the routine LT9.0 the hole size distribution, its mean size and width were calculated. Results obtained from a three and a four component analysis of lifetime spectra are compared. Both polymers show very large orthopositronium lifetimes τ_{3} (corresponding to large hole sizes) and glass transitions in τ_{3} near the expected values. AF 2400 shows an unusual behavior characterized by a nonlinear temperature dependence of the orthopositronium lifetime, extraordinarily large mean values of τ_{3} and the widths of the lifetime distributions σ_{3}. Possible explanations for this will be discussed in relation to the microstructure of the copolymer.\n",

The results are compared with those for CYTOP (T_{g} = 105 °C) and the perfluoroelastomer PFE (T_{g} = -2 °C) as well as for conventional (non-fluorinated) polymers. The PVT data were fitted by the Tait equation and the Simha-Somcynsky (S-S) equation of state (eos). From the latter one the hole fraction h and the specific hole free volume, V_{f} = hV, were determined. From the PALS data published recently by some of the authors (Rudel et al Macromolecules 2008, 41, 788 ) the free volume hole size distribution characterized by its mean, <v_{h}> , and standard deviation, σ_{h}, was calculated. The identification of V_{f} = N_{h}'<v_{h}> from PALS with V_{f} = hV from S-S eos opens the way to estimate the specific hole density N_{h}'. We give evidence for the exceptional large local (<v_{h}> , σ_{h}) and fractional (h) hole free volume in the AF polymers already in the glassy state and relate this to the properties of the particular structure of the heterocyclic dioxole comonomer containing two exocyclic -CF_{3} groups and to the high dioxole fraction in these copolymers. Correlations between the volume parameters at T_{g} (<v_{hg}> , σ_{hg}, and h_{g}) and the value of T_{g} or the mass of the S-S mer, respectively, were analyzed. AF2400 shows in some aspects a particularly irregular behavior.

      "A study of the thermal stability of the outstanding sorption properties of nanoporous-crystalline and amorphous phases of poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene) oxide (PPO) is presented. In particular, the structural changes, as induced by thermal treatments in the temperature range 100-270 °C, of two limit nanoporous-crystalline modifications have been investigated by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Although both PPO nanoporous-crystalline modifications are metastable, their crystallinity reduction is small for thermal treatments up to 200 °C. For the entire thermal treatment range, the uptake of benzene from vapor phase for the PPO nanoporous-crystalline samples is higher than for PPO nanoporous-amorphous samples. After thermal treatments above the polymer glass transition temperature (T_{g} ≈ 220 °C), the guest solubility becomes negligible for the fully amorphous samples, while remains large for the nanoporous-crystalline phases, up to the polymer melting (T_{g} ≈ 250 °C). This high thermal stability of sorbent materials based on PPO nanoporous-crystalline phases is particularly relevant for their thermal regeneration processes.\n",

Investigation of the copolymerization kinetics allowed evaluating the reactivity ratios r_{s} and r_{VF} (r_{s} = k _{S-S} k _{S-VF} ; r_{VF} = k _{VF-VF}k _{VF-S}; M_{S} = styrene; M_{VF} = 2VF) using the Fineman-Ross, Kelen-Tudos, extended Kelen-Tudos, and Meyer-Lowry methods; a quasi-ideal copolymerization behavior was found with reactivity ratios values r_{s} and r_{VF} of 1.21-1.30 and 0.98-1.10, respectively, and reactivity ratio products of ≈1.3-1.6. ^{1}H NMR investigation of the polymerization solution showed that the reaction of 2VF with the Cu(I)-PMDETA/1-PEBr catalyst causes a reduced efficiency in radical initiation reaction; broadening of the average molecular weight distribution was thus observed at short polymerization time. The T_{g} values of the S-co-2VFs range from 105 °C of PS to 54 °C for the S-co-2VF with 2VF mole fraction x_{2VF} of 0.60 (S-co-2VF_{60}); the thermal decomposition of the copolymers starts at about 360 °C in air. The S-co-2VFs are stable in solution and solid state at room temperature, but gelation occurs at 100 °C in 10 % w/w tetrachloroethane solution in air.

      "The stiff backbones of conjugated polymers can lead to a rich phase behavior that includes both crystalline and liquid crystalline phases, making measurements of the glass transition challenging. In this work, the glass transitions of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (RR P3HT), regiorandom (RRa) P3HT, and poly((9,9-bis(2-octyl)-fluorene-2,7-diyl)-alt-(4,7-di(thiophene-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5',5''-diyl) (PFTBT) are probed by linear viscoelastic measurements as a function of molecular weight. We find two glass transition temperatures (T_{g}'s) for both RR and RRa P3HT and one for PFTBT. The higher T_{g}, T_{α}, is associated with the backbone segmental motion and depends on the molecular weight, such that the Flory-Fox model yields T_{α} = 22 and 6 °C in the long chain limit for RR and RRa P3HT, respectively. For RR P3HT, a different molecular weight dependence of T_{α} is seen below M_{n} = 14 kg/mol, suggesting this is the typical molecular weight of intercrystal tie chains. The lower T_{g} (T_{αPE} ≈ -100 °C) is associated with the side chains and is independent of molecular weight. RRa P3HT exhibits a lower T_{α} and higher T_{αPE} than RR P3HT, possibly due to a different degree of nanophase separation between the side chains and the backbones. In contrast, PFTBT only exhibits one T_{g} above -120 °C, at 144 °C in the long chain limit.\n",

One of the monofunctional counterparts of 1 is a derivative of α-methylstyrene, the ceiling temperature of which is low, and the other is an allyl compound that is well-known for the low homopolymerization tendency. This means that the intermolecular propagation reactions leading to pendant uncyclized units are suppressed during the polymerization of 1 to yield highly cyclized polymers. In fact, the degree of cyclization of poly(1) obtained at 140 °C attained the value 92 %. Structural studies revealed that repeat cyclic units of poly(1) consist exclusively of five-membered rings. Poly(1) was found to be stable up to 300 °C, but its T_{g} values were detected at around 100 °C. They are considerably lower than the targeted values which should lie between 180 and 220 °C. An additional drawback of poly(1) is its low molecular weight probably due to a degradative chain transfer. For this reason, copolymerizations of 2 with 1 and with styrene were also carried out to seek for the possibility to control the thermal properties precisely. Monomer 2 was chosen, since it has been reported in our previous work that it yields polymers with thermal stability up to 300 °C and T_{g} higher than 250 °C. Copolymerization of 2 with styrene afforded polymers with desired thermal properties and high molecular weight.\n",

These PIs possessed moderate to great optical transparency and excellent solubility. With four methyl groups at 2,2',5,5'-position in diamine, 2255TMB-PI exhibited the best transmittance up to 82 % at 400 nm. In all cases, PIs were determined to have low dielectric constants (2.84-2.99) and high glass transition temperature (above 390 °C, even up to 407 °C for 2255TMB-PI). In addition, the toughness of these PI films was also proven by a tensile strength of 130-156 MPa. In spite of the electron donating character of methyl groups, their steric hindrance was found to have significant effect on the combination properties of PIs. Spatial structures and packing morphology are thought to be the main contribution. Therefore, this work provided an easy way to prepare highly transparent polyimides with excellent combined properties by controlling steric hindrance through methyl side groups.\n",

Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis measurements showed that poly[(4-MSt)-co-(4-BrMSt)]-b-PIB had two glass-transition temperatures (T_{g}'s), -56 °C for the PIB segment and 62 °C for the poly[(4-MSt)-co-(4-BrMSt)] domain, whereas poly(4-VBTEAB)-b-PIB showed one T_{g} at -8 °C of the PIB domain; T_{g} of the poly[(4-vinylbenzyl triethyl ammonium bromide)-co-(4-methylstyrene)-co-(4-bromomethylstyrene)] domain was not observable because of the strong ionic interactions resulting in a higher T_{g} and a retention of modulus up to 124 °C.\n",

All the copolymers were soluble in common organic solvents and had relatively low glass transition temperature (T_{g} = 50-56 °C for fluorenevinylenes and T_{g} < 25 °C for phenylenevinylene). In THF solutions, the quinoline-containing copolymers showed absorption maxima at 411-420 nm while the bisquinoline-containing ones exhibited maxima at 357-361 nm. The emission maxima of solutions were 465-490 nm. The copolymers showed high quantum yields up to 64 %. The films exhibited absorption and emission maxima in the range of 371-437 nm and 480-521 nm, respectively.

Unhydrogenated diblock copolymers showed two glass transitions due to poly(NBMPI) and polybutadiene segments, such as two glass-transition temperatures at -86.5 and 115.3 °C for poly1a and -87.2 and 115.3 °C for poly1b. However, only one melting temperature could be observed for hydrogenated copolymers, such as 119.8 °C for poly2a and 121.7 °C for poly2b. The unhydrogenated diblock copolymer with the longer poly(NBMPI) chain (poly1a; temperature at 10 % mass loss = 400 °C) exhibited better thermal stability than the one with the shorter poly(NBMPI) chain (poly1b; temperature at 10 % mass loss = 385 °C). Two kinds of hydrogenated diblock copolymers, poly2a and poly2b, exhibited relatively poor solubility but better thermal stability than unhydrogenated diblock copolymers because of the polyethylene segments. Poly[(hydrochloride quaternized 2-norbornene-5-methyleneamine)-b-butadiene]-1 (poly3a) was obtained after the hydrolysis and quaternization of poly1a. Dynamic light scattering measurements indicated that the hydrodynamic diameters of the cationic copolymer (poly3a) in water (hydrodynamic diameter = 1580 nm without salt), methanol/water (4/96 v/v; hydrodynamic diameter = 1500 nm without salt), and tetrahydrofuran/water (4/96 v/v; hydrodynamic diameter = 1200 nm without salt) decreased with increasing salt (NaCl) concentration. The effect of temperature on the hydrodynamic diameter of hydrophobically modified poly3a was also studied. The inflection point of the hydrodynamic diameter of poly3a was observed at various polymer concentrations around 30 °C.

The pyridine units are present as trimeric monomers in these copolymers and have different connectivities to their two neighboring thiophenes, para- and meta-linkages. We investigated the variations in the optical and electrochemical properties of the copolymers that arise from these different connectivities. The two polymers exhibit 5 % weight loss above 410 °C and high glass transition temperatures (T_{g}: 113 °C for PFO-TPy25T, 142 °C for PFO-TPy26T). The UV-vis absorption maximum peaks of PFO-TPy25T and PFO-TPy26T in the solid state were found to be 449 and 398 nm respectively, with photoluminescence maximum peaks in the solid state of 573 and 490 nm respectively. Using cyclic voltammetry, we determined their energy band gaps: 3.08 eV for PFO-TPy25T and 3.49 eV for PFO-TPy25T.

The thermal properties of poly(ethylene oxide) poly(N-substituted urethane) (N-sub PEOPU) were investigated in view of the N-substitution degree and properties of the substituent. The chemical structures were characterized by Fourier transform infrared, ^{1}H NMR, and ^{13}C NMR spectroscopies. DSC and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to investigate the thermal properties of N-sub PEOPUs. As the degree of N-methylation increased, the glass-transition temperature (T_{g}) of the N-sub PEOPUs linearly decreased from 6 to -29 °C, and the weight-loss temperature of 5 % (T) from TGA in air increased from 278 to 360 °C. In the fully N-substituted PEOPUs, the behavior of the thermal decomposition of the PEOPU that was processed in two stages was changed to one-step decomposition in the temperature range of 360-440 °C. The T_{g} was shifted to a lower temperature with an increasing length of the substituent in N-sub PEOPU.

      "Two sets of sucrose-based epoxy monomers, namely, epoxy allyl sucroses (EAS), and epoxy crotyl sucroses (ECS), were prepared by epoxidation of octa-O-allyl and octa-O-crotyl sucroses (OAS and OCS, respectively). Synthetic and structural characterization studies showed that the new epoxy monomers were mixtures of structural isomers and diastereoisomers that contained varying numbers of epoxy groups per sucrose. EAS and ECS can be tailored to contain an average of one to eight epoxy groups per sucrose. Quantitative ^{13}C-NMR spectrometry and titrimetry were used independently to confirm the average number of epoxy groups per sucrose. Sucrose-based epoxy monomers were cured with diethylenetriamine (DETA) in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and their curing characteristics were compared with those of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and diepoxycrotyl ether of bisphenol A (DECEBA). EAS and DGEBA cured at 100 to 125 °C and exhibited a heat of cure of about 108.8 kJ per mol epoxy. ECS and DECEBA cured at 150 and 171 °C, respectively, and exhibited a heat of cure of about 83.7 kJ per mol epoxy. Depending upon the degree of epoxidation (average number of epoxy groups per sucrose) and the concentration of DETA, glass transition temperatures (T_{g}s) of cured EAS varied from -17 to 72 °C. DETA-cured ECS containing an average of 7.3 epoxy groups per sucrose (ECS-7.3) showed no DSC glass transition between -140 and 220 °C when the ratio of amine (NH) to epoxy group was 1:1 and 1.5:1. Maximum T_{g}s obtained for DETA-cured DGEBA and DECEBA polymers were 134 and 106 °C, respectively.

From the temperature dependence of the lifetime of ortho-positronium (o-Ps), τ_{3}, for the network polymer of poly(ethylene oxide-co-propylene oxide) [P(EO/PO)], an onset temperature for limited local motions of molecules, T_{γ}, and the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, were determined to be 57 and 201 K, respectively. For the network polymer of poly[EO-co-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl glycidyl ether] [P(EO/MEEGE)], T_{γ} and T_{g} were determined to be 57 and 185 K, respectively. For both specimens, above 270 K, the observed linear temperature dependence of τ_{3} was attributed to the thermal expansion of open spaces in a liquid state. In the temperature range between T_{γ} and 270 K, for the P(EO/MEEGE) network, τ_{3} was longer and its intensity was smaller than those for the P(EO/PO) network. These results were attributed to the increase in the size of open spaces for the P(EO/MEEGE) network polymer and the blocking of these regions by motions of side chains and chain ends.\n",

Then, this small molecule is utilized to prepare oligomer, linear polymer and the corresponding crosslinked polymer (denoted as P_{2}) by using thiol-ene and thiol-oxidation reactions. The polymer P_{2} can form brown film on a glass substrate and can be easily put off from the substrate. Mechanical properties of P_{2} show that tensile strength value is about 6 MPa, with elongation at break of around 300 %. Glass transition temperature (Tg) of P_{2} is -2.76 °C, meaning that P_{2} is at rubber state. There are hydroxyl groups in the prepared linear polymer, which further reacts with 1,6-hexanediisocyanate (HDI) to form polyurethane P_{4} with crosslinked structures. Compared with P_{2}, the polyurethane P_{4} forms yellow film on a glass substrate. But the film of P_{4} is not so flexible as that of P_{2}, presumably because of relatively higher Tg (5.85 °C) of P_{4} than P_{2}. Due to the existence of dynamic disulfide bonds as well as hydrogen bonds in both P_{2} and P_{4}, these thermoset resins show repeatable self-healing behavior stimulated by UV irradiation. Furthermore, the polyurethane P_{4} exhibits ultrahigh temperature resistance performance, with Td_{5} = 375 °C and Td_{10} = 1000 °C according to TGA curve.

Different amounts of tetrapropyl zirconate (TPZ) were added in polymer solution using anhydrous dimethylformamide as solvent. TPZ was hydrolyzed and condensed in situ in the matrix for the generation of inorganic networks using diethylamine. Thin and transparent films containing different proportions of zirconia were obtained by evaporating the solvent. Mechanical, dynamic mechanical thermal and morphological analyses of these films were carried out. An increase in tensile modulus was observed with the films containing zirconia contents up to 15 wt %, but the elongation at rupture was found to decrease sharply on further addition of zirconia. Toughness of the hybrid materials decreased with increased amount of zirconia. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) performed on the samples indicates an increase in the glass transition temperature; 102 °C with pure polyamide to 132 °C with polyamide containing 15 wt % zirconia contents. The storage modulus was also found to increase with increase in zirconia proportion in the matrix. The decrease in the storage modulus of the hybrids with rise in temperature was observed to be much smaller as compared with that of pure polymer. Thermal decomposition temperatures of the hybrids were found in the range of 450-500 °C. The weights of the residues left at 700 °C were nearly proportional to the zirconia contents in the original hybrids.

In this study, TPS-based green composites containing various amounts of high-stiff cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), 0-9 wt %, were prepared in an internal mixer to modify the abovementioned drawbacks. The CNCs prepared via acid hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) at different temperatures were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The AFM micrographs showed that MCC hydrolysis at 44 °C resulted in CNCs with the highest yield of 37 % and average length and width of 272 nm and 61 nm, respectively. Adding CNC level from 0 to 9 wt % considerably increased the tensile strength of the TPS from 3.1 to 11.1 MPa (358 %), Young's modulus from 237.3 MPa to 4.2 GPa, and the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) from 69.2 to 90.7 °C. The relatively good interfacial interaction between CNC and TPS matrix due to rather similar polysaccharide structure in both CNC and starch caused a remarkable improvement of these mechanical properties. Furthermore, the introduction of 9 wt % CNCs decreased water vapor permeability (WVP) of the TPS from 3.4 x 10^{-6} to 1.3 x 10^{-6} g m^{-1}h^{-1}Pa^{-1}. In fact, the barrier effect of the CNC plates with relatively high aspect ratio decreased the WVP of the resultant nanocomposite.\n",

The glass transition temperature (218 °C) of the polymer was higher than that of SMA (202 °C) due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The polymer underwent thermal degradation in two steps where the initial weight loss began to occur at about 230 °C due to the formation of acid anhydride bonds with loss of water. SMA-AP exhibited bactericidal activity against E. coli and S. aureus, but it did not show any inhibition zone against the bacteria cells.

Thermal analysis showed that the glass transition temperature of xyloglucan was decreased from 252 °C to 216 °C following the grafting of PLLA. The grafting of less hydrophilic chains from xyloglucan also affected the interaction with water: the PLLA-grafted xyloglucan was insoluble in water and the moisture uptake could be decreased by about 30 %.

It was found that the participation of carbonyl group in hydrogen bonding increased with the content of dimethyol propionic acid in PU. The properties of the PU films including tensile strength and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were studied. The tensile strength of PU films increased whereas the storage modulus decreased with increasing dimethyol propionic acid content. The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of the PU film with only 1,4-butane diol as the chain extender was 4 °C, while that of the films with dimethyol propionic acid as the chain extender was at about -15 °C. Wettability and protein adsorption on the films were evaluated from the water content, contact angle, and protein adsorptions of fibrinogen and albumin on the PU films. The diffusion coefficient of water in the membrane was determined in accordance with the Fickian diffusion mechanism. No significant difference in the diffusion coefficient was observed for all the specimens. By using the Kaelble's equation and the contact angle data, the surface tensions of the PU films with different amounts of dimethyol propionic acid were determined. The surface tension of PU film was found to increase with increasing dimethyol propionic acid content, while the opposite trend was observed for the contact angle and the amount of protein adsorption.\n",

      "Thin film composite (TFC) membranes for gas separation often comprise a thin selective layer of a glassy polymer, which, however, suffers from physical aging, ie, gas permeance decreases with time. This study aims to provide a mechanistic understanding of the effect of physical aging on permeance reduction in TFC membranes. The Part I study reports gas permeances in two-layer TFC membranes comprising perfluoropolymers of Teflon(r) AF or Hyflon(r) AD with thicknesses of 50-400 nm. In this Part II study, apparent glass transition temperature (T g) of thin selective layers was determined in situ over time using a nano-thermal analysis (nano-TA). Physical aging decreases gas permeances and increases apparent T g, and the rate of changes is more significant for thinner selective layers. For example, N_{2} permeance decreases from 1000 gpu to 550 gpu while apparent T g increases from 160 °C to 172 °C after aging for 2000 h in a membrane with 100-nm-thick Teflon AF1600. The measured T g values are used to derive polymer fractional free volume and physical aging rate. A simplified free volume model is used to successfully correlate the gas permeance reduction with T g increase during physical aging. Polymers with good stability of permeability should have low physical aging rate and high fractional free volume.\n",

      "New triarylamine-based polymers have been synthesized by polyaddition of 4-tolyldiphenylamine (TDPA) with 1,4-divinylbenzene (DVB) or 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene (IPB) in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid. ^{1}H NMR spectra revealed that DVB units were linked to TDPA units not only at p-position but also at m-position to aryl group in TDPA-DVB polymer. On the other hand, IPB was less reactive and TDPA-IPB polymer was achieved only in a p-linkage. The incorporation of DVB or IPB did not significantly affect the electronic structure of TDPA unit as confirmed by UV spectra and cyclic voltammetry. From differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements, glass transition temperatures of TDPA-DVB and TDPA-IPB polymers were estimated to be 169 °C and 132 °C, respectively. The resulting polymers have good solubility in conventional organic solvents (e. g. chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and toluene).\n",

Cyclic voltammetry studies showed a higher HOMO level (-5.23 eV) than the polyfluorene homopolymer(PFO). The glass transition temperature of the copolymer (110 °C) was much higher than that of the PFO (67 °C). After the copolymer had been annealed at 200 °C for 2 h, the PL spectra showed almost no change and no aggregation- or oxidation-related undesirable long-wavelength emission has been observed. The light-emitting diode in configuration of ITO/PEDOT/EML/CsF/Al showed a maximum external quantum efficiency of 1.54 % with a luminance of 435 cd * m^{-2} and the maximum brightness of 2 630 cd * m^{-2} with CIE coordinate (0.17, 0.14) was achieved at 8.4 V. The device prepared in configuration of ITO/PEDOT/PVK/polymer/Ba/Al exhibits an efficient, stable blue emission; it has a turn-on voltage of 6 V and maximum external quantum efficiency of 1.1 %. The EL emission remains stable at high current density and after thermal treatment at 150 °C for 30 min. Extremely color-stable blue emission from alternating poly[(2,7-fluorene)-co-(3,9-carbazole)] copolymer makes it a promising candidate for flat-panel display applications.\n",

      "Summary: Novel PPV derivatives (PCA8-PV and PCA8-MEHPV) containing N-phenyl-carbazole units on the backbone were successfully synthesized by the Wittig polycondensation of 3,6-bisformyl-N-(4-octyloxy-phenyl)carbazole with the corresponding tributyl phosphonium salts in good yields. The newly formed and dominant trans vinylene double bonds were confirmed by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. The polymers (with of 6 289 for PCA8-PV and 7 387 for PCA8-MEHPV) were soluble in common organic solvents and displayed high thermal stability (T_{g}s are 110.7 °C for PCA8-PV and 92.2 °C for PCA8-MEHPV, respectively) because of the incorporation of the N-phenyl-carbazole units. Cyclic voltammetry investigations (onsets: 0.8 V for PCA8-PV and 0.7 V for PCA8-MEHPV) suggested that the polymers possess enhanced hole injection/transport properties, which can be also attributed to the N-phenyl-carbazole units on the backbone. Both the single-layer and the double-layer light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that used the polymers as the active layer emitted a greenish-blue or bluish-green light (the maximum emissions located 494 nm for PCA8-PV and 507 nm for PCA8-MEHPV, respectively). Compared with those of the single-layer devices, the emission efficiencies of the double-layer devices, in which an electron-transporting layer (Alq_{3}) was added, were enhanced by a factor of 10, implying that the better hole-electron balance is achieved because of the incorporation of the electron-transporting layer.\n",

The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies indicate that the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of PI/SiW_{11}KH550 copolymers increases from 330 °C (for neat PI) to 409 °C (for the copolymer sample with 10 wt % of SiW_{11}KH550). Dielectric measurement showed that both the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss for the copolymer thin films decreased with the increase in SiW_{11}KH550 content, and the dielectric constant and dielectric loss values decreased to 2.1 and 3.54 x 10^{-3}, respectively, for the copolymer sample with 10 wt % of SiW_{11}KH550.

High plasticizer concentrations (40 %) and a thermal after-treatment (curing) were necessary for the coalescence of the polymer particles and good film formation. Ethylcellulose required a higher curing temperature and time than Eudragit^{(r)} RS because of its higher glass transition temperature (133 versus 58 °C).

A relatively lower molecular weight of the corresponding hydroquinone-functionalized form was measured. The glass transition temperature of the modified polymeric material was lower than that of the pristine one: 78.82 °C for HQ-PAAm versus 161.19 °C for PAAm. A study of Cu(II) adsorption by the cross-linked PAAm and HQ-PAAm resins was conducted by varying the following parameters: pH, time, temperature, ionic strength, sorbent mass, and initial Cu(II) concentration. The adsorption capacity of Pb(II) and Cd(II) by the different resins and their corresponding extents of desorption were estimated.

Monomers having linear alkoxy groups polymerized to give relatively high molecular weight polymers (M_{n}=40 300-49 600) in good yields. However, the molecular weights and yields of the polymers having branched alkoxy groups were relatively low because of the steric effect of branched alkoxy chains. The methoxyethoxy group-containing monomer afforded an oligomer with an M_{n} of 666. The coupling reaction of tetrasubstituted p-dibromobenzenes occurred at a very-low level because of the steric hindrance of the tetra substituents. Polymers 2a-f exhibited high thermal stability, and the decomposition temperatures were higher than 350 °C.

The molecular weights reached ca. 7.6 kDa, corresponding to degrees of polymerization of ca. 24, with polydispersities ranging from 2.0 to 3.5, as measured by SEC using tetrahydrofuran as the eluent and with polystyrene calibration standards. Partially because of the presence of the bicyclic backbone, each regioisomeric poly(quinic acid carbonate) exhibited relatively high glass-transition temperatures, 209 °C for poly(1,4-quinic acid carbonate) and 229 °C for poly(1,5-quinic acid carbonate). Removal of the TBS-protecting groups was studied under mild conditions to achieve control over potential competing reactions involving polymer degradation, which could include cleavage of lactones within the repeat units, carbonate linkages, or both between the repeat units. Full deprotection was not achieved without some degree of polymer degradation. The regiochemistry of the monomer showed significant impact on the reactivity during deprotection and also on the thermal properties, with the 1,5-regioisomeric polymer having lower reactivity and giving higher T_{g} values, in comparison with the 1,4-regioisomer. Each regioisomer underwent a 10-20 °C increase in T_{g} upon partial removal of the TBS-protecting groups. As the extent of deprotection increased, the solubility decreased. Ultimately, at long deprotection reaction times, the solubility increased and the T_{g} decreased because of significant degradation of the polymers.\n",

The TiO_{2} based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated using the doped polymer electrolytes and their performance was tested; HBPEU-2 showed good performance by yielding energy conversion efficiency (η) of 4.5 %.\n",

      "Two new semifluorinated aromatic copoly(ether amide)s have been synthesized by direct polycondensation reaction of 5-t-butyl isophthalic acid (TIPA) with two different aromatic diamines; bis-2,2-[4-{2'-trifluoromethyl-4'-(4''-aminophenyl) phenoxy}phenyl]isopropylidene (BTAPPI) and bis-9,9-[4-{2'-trifluoromethyl-4'-(4''-aminophenyl)phenoxy}phenyl]fluorenylidene (BTAPPF) and, 4,4'-oxydianiline (ODA) as a comonomer in all cases. These polymers showed very good solubility in organic solvents like DMF, DMAc, NMP and pyridine. The polymers showed very good thermal stabilities, the temperature for 10 % wt loss in nitrogen and air were upto 422 °C and 412 °C, respectively. The copoly(ether amide)s synthesized exhibited glass transition temperature (T_{g}) 248 (BTAPPI-ODA-TIPA) and 263 °C (BTAPPF-ODA-TIPA). DMA analysis showed very good retention of storage modulus of the polymer up to T_{g}. The copoly(ether amide) films were flexible with tensile strength up to 91 MPa, elongation at break up to 15 % and modulus of elasticity up to 1.69 GPa depending on amine used and the exact repeating unit structure. These copoly(ether amide)s were less crystalline in nature in comparison to the homopolyamide synthesized using ODA as diamine but more crystalline than the homopolyamide synthesized using BTAPPI and BTAPPF as diamines. Water absorption study showed hydrophobic nature of the polymers. The copoly(ether amide)s showed non-Newtonian (pseudoplastic) behavior at higher applied shear rate.\n",

      "In this study, polymer blends comprising poly(D/L) lactic acid (PDLLA) and 0-30 wt % polycaprolactone (PCL) was prepared by a solvent-evaporation technique. The effect of PCL content on the dynamic-mechanical properties and tensile and flexural characteristics of the blends was evaluated. The creep and stress relaxation behaviors were also determined and using various known models such as power law, Burgers model and Weibull distribution equation. The results showed that by increasing the PCL content from 10 to 30 wt %, the yield stress and flexural strength decreased from 47 MPa to 26 MPa and 72 MPa to 29 MPa respectively. In addition to tensile and flexural strength, the elastic modulus of neat PDLLA declined with increasing the PCL content, whereas the elongation or the strain percentage at the break point increased considerably. Biphasic regions were observed in the microstructures of the blends, indicating the immiscibility of PCL in PDLLA matrix. However, the PCL spherulites with an average particle diameter of 100 nm to 5 μm were homogeneously dispersed in PDLLA phase even at high PCL concentrations. Moreover, the microstructures of the fractured surfaces of the polymers confirmed that PDLLA with a brittle fracture behavior tends toward a soft fracture behavior when it is blended with PCL. The dynamic-mechanical tests indicated that the damping energy and dissipative ability of PDLLA improve by adding PCL. Moreover, T_{g} of neat PDLLA by adding of 10, 20 and 30 wt % decreases from 67.3 to 66.2, 65.1 and 63.5 °C respectively. Increasing in the recovered viscoelastic strain due to the addition of PCL was also experienced which can be attributed to the presence of large volumetric backbone of PCL chains as well as easy movement of them in the matrix. The results of modeling studies showed a good correlation between the experimentally obtained data.\n",

      "In this study, a member of a newly developed biodegradable amino acid-based poly(ester amide)s family (ie,phenylalanine-based PEA, or 8-Phe-4) was chosen as a model biomaterial for such an MD simulation study, and its glass transition temperature (T_{g}) and adhesion behavior on the magnesium (Mg) metal surface were examined and compared with the reported experimental data for assessing the accuracy and validity of this new tool in biomaterial research. For comparison, the adhesive behavior of a commercially available absorbable aliphatic polyester biomaterial, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) on the same Mg metal surface was studied. The MD simulation results indicate that the calculated T_{g} of 8-Phe-4 is 325-326 K, which agrees well with the experimental value 320 K within the normal ±5 % experimental error. The simulated adhesion data show that both 8-Phe-4 and PLGA can be coated on the Mg surface very well and the work of adhesion calculations show that, in 180-450 K temperature range,8-Phe-4 on Mg (0001) surface has a much stronger adhesion than PLGA on Mg surface. The results suggest that MD simulation is a powerful tool to aid or even guide biomaterial scientists and engineers in their search for better and efficient experimental designs for the desirable and efficient outcomes.\n",

The chemical structures of obtained hybrids are proved to be PDMS-b-PMMA_{408}-b-P(MA-POSS)_{4.5, 8.2, 13.6} with molecular weight of 50,090-58650 g mol^{-1} (PDI = 1.215-1.391). With the increase of P(MA-POSS)_{n} content from 0 %wt to 23.93 %wt, the glass transition temperature of PDMS-b-PMMA_{408}-b-P(MA-POSS)_{n} is enhanced from 95 °C to 137 °C, and the corresponding storage modulus of mechanical property is increased from 579 ± 3 MPa to 902 ± 5 MPa. The surface of PDMS-b-PMMA_{408}-b-P(MA-POSS)_{8.2} film casting from CHCl_{3} solution obtains higher water contact angle (120°) and higher water adsorption (Δf = -2300 Hz), but lower viscoelasticity (ΔD = 26 x 10^{-6}) than the film casting from tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution (114°, Δf = -1540 Hz, ΔD = 52 x 10^{-6}). This is because that 200-500 nm core/shell micelles of PMMA core and PDMS/P(MA-POSS) shell formed in CHCl_{3} solution are favor of the migration of PDMS and P(MA-POSS) onto film surface to improve the surface roughness (2.480 nm) and to get silicon-rich surface (14.62 %) than 220 nm P(MA-POSS) core/PMMA shell/PDMS-corona micelles formed in THF solution (0.906 nm, 7.86 %). Therefore, the accumulated P(MA-POSS) cages on the film surface are able to store absorbed water but do not increase the viscoelasticity of film. The results indicate that PDMS-b-PMMA_{408}-b-P(MA-POSS)_{n} are promising to be the solvent-dependent coating materials.\n",

      "Aqueous silicone-acrylic dispersions with core-shell particle structure can be obtained in the process of emulsion polymerization of acrylic or methacrylic monomers in previously synthesized silicone resin dispersions. If the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of the shell is around +120 °C or higher, drying of such dispersions leads to \"nanopowders\" which can be applied as impact modifiers for powder coatings and plastics due to the presence of low T_{g} silicone resin contained in the hybrid nanoparticles. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of silicone resin composition on the properties of dispersions and the corresponding nanopowders what, in turn, was expected to influence the properties of powder coatings modified with such nanopowders. Silicone resin dispersions (DSI) were synthesized by emulsion polymerization of three silicone monomers: octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), methyltrimethoxysilane (METMS) and methacryloyltrimethoxysilane (MATMS) in the presence of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid playing the role of both surfactant and polymerization catalyst. Silicone-acrylic hybrid dispersions (DASI) having core-shell particle structure confirmed by TEM were further obtained by emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate in DSI, and eventually nanopowders (NP-DASI) were produced by spray-drying of DASI. A designed experiment was conducted where the different proportions of D4, METMS and MATMS were used in DSI synthesis and a range of properties of DSI, DASI and NP-DASI were tested. A significant effect of starting silicone monomers composition (reflected in silicone resin structure) on dispersion particle size was observed what could be explained by differences in their hydrophobicity. SEM investigations revealed that NP-DASI were produced in the form of 1-10 μm agglomerates of round-shaped nanoparticles of ca. 120 nm in size. Two clear glass transition temperatures (T_{g}) of NP-DASI were identified by DSC: one attributed to silicone part - around -120 °C - and the other attributed to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMM) part - around +120 °C. T_{g} attributed to silicone part decreased with increased share of D4 and MATMS in the silicone monomers composition while T_{g} of PMM part showed a minimum for specific composition of silicone monomers.\n",

Chemical composition of polyesters was analyzed by GCMS and NMR. The copolyester produced by P. guezennei from glucose mainly consisted of 3-hydroxyoctanoate and 3-hydroxydecanoate, and the presence of 3-hydroxydodec-5-enoate was demonstrated. Using sodium octanoate as the sole nutrient, the microorganism produced a poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) (PHO) polymer containing up to 94 mol % 3-hydroxyoctanoate. Biosynthesis of poly[(3-hydroxyoctanoate)-co-(3-hydroxyundecenoate)] (PHOU) copolymers bearing terminal reactive double bonds on its side chains with unsaturation degree ranging from 8.8 % to 78.2 % was obtained by tuning the ratio of sodium octanoate/10-undecenoic acid in the medium. Thermal analysis indicated semi-crystalline polymers with melting temperatures (T_{m}) ranging from 46 to 55 °C, fusion enthalpy (ΔH) comprised between 3 and 35 J/g and glass transition temperature (T_{g}) from -36 to -44 °C, except for the highly amorphous 78.2 % unsaturated PHOU with a low T_{g} (-50 °C). Molecular weights determined by GPC ranged from 119 000 and 530 000 g/mol.

      "The use of various harmful organic solvents for microparticle formulations is still widespread. Here, an alternative low toxicity solvent (propylene carbonate; PC) is proposed for the preparation of poly(lactic-co-glycolic-acid) (PLGA) microparticles. Based on the classical emulsification-solvent extraction methodology, the use of PC offers the unique advantage of an additional solvent extraction step using hydrolytic solvent cleavage during microparticle preparation. Spherical, rough-surfaced microparticles were obtained with a volume median diameter range from 20 to 60 um. The residual PC content has been identified to be the major factor for the solidification hindrance, leading to polymeric Tg shifting due to a plasticizing effect. When applying the enhanced PC extraction step, the residual PC content was lowered from 8.8 % to 2.7 % and subsequently Tg values shifted from 8.2 to 37.7 °C. Additionally, the hydrolytic solvent cleavage confirmed to have no impact on the PLGA stability. This method presents a significant advancement towards replacing of conventional solvents in the microparticle preparation due to more efficient solvent extraction.\n",

The NESD was modulated through biometric simulation and computational prototyping to produce a binary crosslinked alginate scaffold embedding stable DA-loaded cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) nanoparticles optimized in accordance with Box-Behnken statistical designs. The physicomechanical properties of the NESD were characterized and in vitro and in vivo release studies performed. Prototyping predicted a 3D NESD model with enhanced internal micro-architecture. SEM and TEM revealed spherical, uniform and non-aggregated DA-loaded nanoparticles with the presence of CAP (FTIR bands at 1070, 1242 and 2926 cm^{-1}). An optimum nanoparticle size of 197 nm (PdI = 0.03), a zeta potential of -34.00 mV and a DEE of 63 % was obtained. The secondary crosslinker BaCl_{2} imparted crystallinity resulting in significant thermal shifts between native CAP (T_{g} = 160-170 °C; T_{m} = 192 °C) and CAP nanoparticles (T_{g} = 260 °C; T_{m} = 268 °C). DA release displayed an initial lag phase of 24 h and peaked after 3 days, maintaining favorable CSF (10 μg/mL) versus systemic concentrations (1-2 μg/mL) over 30 days and above the inherent baseline concentration of DA (1 μg/mL) following implantation in the parenchyma of the frontal lobe of the Sprague-Dawley rat model.

      "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of molecular weight (MW) of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on glass transition and crystallization of sucrose. Thus, sucrose was co-lyophilized with 2.5 and 5.0 % w/w PVP of different molecular weights, which were characterized using gel permeation chromatography. Freeze drying was carried out for 48 h at a shelf temperature of -40 °C and a pressure of about 36 Pa. The samples were then dried in a vacuum oven at 24 °C for 12 h before drying for a further 12 h at 40 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to measure the glass transition temperature (T_{g}), dynamic crystallization temperature (T_{c}) and isothermal crystallization induction time (t_{c}) at 85 °C of sucrose. Isothermal water vapour sorption of each sample was also measured at different relative humidities. T_{g} values of sucrose varied from 48.3±0.8 °C for freeze-dried (FD) sucrose alone to 58.8±0.8 °C for the mixture containing 5.0 % PVP of nominal MW 300 K. PVP increased sucrose T_{g} significantly (ANOVA P<0.05). Although there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in T_{g} of the mixtures containing 2.5 % w/w PVP of different MW, samples with 5.0 % PVP of MW 300 K produced a significantly higher (P<0.05) T_{g} than the other mixtures. All mixtures were shown to possess higher (P<0.01) T_{c} than FD sucrose alone, which exhibited a T_{c} of approximately 85 °C. PVP of MW 300 K consistently induced a significantly (P<0.05) higher T_{c} of sucrose than PVP of smaller MW. Increasing PVP concentration from 2.5 to 5.0 % also resulted in a substantial increase in sucrose T_{c}. Using isothermal water vapour absorption, sucrose t_{c} was found to increase up to over 10 times when it was co-lyophilized with 2.5 % PVP, the actual value of t_{c} being dependent upon the MW of the PVP. For example, PVP of MW 300 K resulted in a sucrose t_{c} at 85 °C (89.1-95.6 min), which was approximately seven times higher than that of 2.5 % PVP of MW 24 or 40 K. A longer t_{c} of sucrose was also observed for mixtures containing PVP of MW 300 K than when sucrose was mixed with PVP of smaller MW. Thus the effect of PVP on sucrose T_{g}, T_{c} and t_{c} was found to be dependent upon MW. PVP of higher MW was more efficient in inhibiting sucrose crystallization and by stabilizing glassy structures of the sugar, these polymers may improve the stability of co-lyophilized proteins and peptides.\n",

      "A one-step method of plant oil direct transesterification was used to synthesize new vinyl monomers from sunflower (SFM), linseed (LSM), soybean (SBM), and olive (OVM) oils. The degree of unsaturation in plant oil fatty acids was used as a criterion to compare the free radical polymerization behavior of new monomers. The number-average molecular weight of plant oil-based homopolymers synthesized in toluene in the presence of AIBN at 75 °C varies at 11 000-25 000 and decreases as follows: poly(OVM) > poly(SFM) > poly(SBM) > poly(LSM), corresponding to increasing degree of unsaturation in the monomers. Rate of polymerization depends noticeably on the degree of unsaturation in monomers. Due to the allylic termination, chain propagation coexists with effective chain transfer during polymerization. The obtained values of C_{M} (ratio of chain transfer and propagation rate constants) depends on monomer structure as follows: C_{M}(LSM) > C_{M}(SBM) > C_{M}(SFM) > C_{M}(OVM). ^{1}H NMR spectroscopy shows that the fraction of the reacting allylic atoms does not vary significantly for the synthesized monomers (7-12 %) and is determined entirely by plant oil degree of unsaturation. The glass transition temperature of homopolymers [T_{g} = 4.2 °C for poly(SFM), T_{g} = -6 °C for poly(SBM)] from new monomers indicates that varying biobased fragments in copolymers might considerably change the intermolecular interactions of macromolecules and their physicochemical properties.\n",

The effects of the substituent group to PPF on the thermal properties, mechanical properties, and gas barrier properties were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), tensile testing, and the oxygen permeation test. The introduction of the methyl group with a hydrogen atom altered the thermal behavior and gas barrier properties of copolyesters, suggesting that the glass temperature (T_{g}) and the melting temperature (T_{m}) were decreased as the 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (MPO) content increased.

      "A high performance, low cost, and environmentally friendly epoxy is demonstrated for the first time by copolymerizing a small amount of epoxide-terminated hyperbranched polyether (EHBPE) with DGEBA. Unlike typical epoxy systems, which involve large amounts of costly, toxic, and volatile curing agents, homopolymerized epoxy curing systems use only small amounts of catalysts instead of curing agents. However, high performance homopolymerized epoxy has not been reported so far, mainly due to brittleness and somewhat uncontrolled fast curing. Our results show that the addition of small amounts of epoxide-terminated hyperbranched polyether (EHBPE) into DGEBA can lead to simultaneous improvements in strength, toughness, and T_{g}. At 5 wt % EHBPE loading, the homopolymerized hybrid epoxy shows balanced mechanical performance and is suitable for structural materials. In the first part of the work, the effects of catalyst type and catalyst concentration were optimized using neat DGEBA. In the second part, DGEBA/EHBPE hybrid epoxy systems were cured and tested using those optimized conditions. Compared with neat DGEBA, the addition of 5 wt % EHBPE can increase toughness and tensile strength by 47.6 % and 18.8 %, respectively; in addition, T_{g} also increases from 171 to 173 °C.\n",

      "This paper reports the study of the influence of the macrocyclic or linear topology of polylactide (PLA) on its resulting thermal and mechanical properties, when displaying identical molar masses. Even if both macrocyclic and linear PLAs crystallize in the same α phase, the results of the calorimetric study and of the tensile tests show some differences which are directly related to the topology of the polymer. The glass transition temperature of macrocyclic PLA was found to be slightly higher than that of the linear one (56 vs 53 °C) while its melting temperature is lower (165 vs 171 °C). Moreover, the crystallization rate of the macrocyclic PLA is slower than that of the linear PLA. Regarding the tensile tests, it has been observed that the macrocyclic PLA displays an earlier strain-hardening than the linear one when stretched in the rubbery state. These differences were attributed to the fact that the macrocyclic topology involves a more constrained entangled network than its linear analogous and/or that the disentanglement kinetics is faster in linear PLA than in macrocyclic PLA.\n",

Currently, the majority derive from oil, do not degrade or undergo chemical recycling. Here a new series of ABA triblock polyesters are synthesized and show high-performances as degradable thermoplastic elastomers; their composition is poly(cyclohexene-alt-phthalate)-b-poly(ε-decalactone)-b-poly(cyclohexene-alt-phthalate) {PE-PDL-PE}. The synthesis is accomplished using a zinc(II)/magnesium(II) catalyst, in a one-pot procedure where ε-decalactone ring-opening polymerization yielding dihydroxyl telechelic poly(ε-decalatone) (PDL, soft-block) occurs first and, then, addition of phthalic anhydride/cyclohexene oxide ring-opening copolymerization delivers semi-aromatic polyester (PE, hard-block) end-blocks. The block compositions are straightforward to control, from the initial monomer stoichiometry, and conversions are high (85-98 %). Two series of polyesters are prepared: (1) TBPE-1 to TBPE-5 feature an equivalent hard-block volume fraction (f_{hard} = 0.4) and variable molar masses 40-100 kg mol^{-1}; (2) TBPE-5 to TBPE-9 feature equivalent molar masses (~100 kg mol^{-1}) and variable hard-block volume fractions (0.12 < f_{hard} < 0.4). Polymers are characterized using spectroscopies, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). They are amorphous, with two glass transition temperatures (~-51 °C for PDL; +138 °C for PE), and block phase separation is confirmed using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Tensile mechanical performances reveal thermoplastic elastomers (f_{hard} < 0.4 and N > 1300) with linear stress-strain relationships, high ultimate tensile strengths (σ_{b} = 1-5 MPa), very high elongations at break (ε_{b} = 1000-1900 %) and excellent elastic recoveries (98 %). There is a wide operating temperature range (-51 to +138 °C), an operable processing temperature range (+100 to +200 °C) and excellent thermal stability (T_{d,5 %} ~ 300 °C). The polymers are stable in aqueous environments, at room temperature, but are hydrolyzed upon gentle heating (60 °C) and treatment with an organic acid (para-toluene sulfonic acid) or a common lipase (Novozyme(r) 51032). The new block polyesters show significant potential as sustainable thermoplastic elastomers with better properties than well-known styrenic block copolymers or polylactide-derived elastomers.

However, precisely controlling the physical properties of a lignin-based epoxy resin based on the structure-property relationship is difficult because lignin is a heterogeneous macromolecule with unclarified substructures. The degradation of lignin into its monomers and their subsequent use as a building block for epoxy resins is another possible synthetic route, but this approach suffers from the formation of a wide variety of products by the chemical degradation of lignin. Herein, we successfully demonstrate that the selective degradation of lignin into the C2-acetal monomer by solvolysis in a hydrophobic solvent, ie, toluene, containing methanolic H_{2}SO_{4} and the subsequent synthesis of a cross-linked structure through the phenol units of C2-acetal enabled the rational control of the thermodynamic properties of a lignin-based epoxy resin. To introduce a flexible structure into the lignin-based epoxy resin, the transacetalization of C2-acetal with di(trimethylolpropane) (DTMP) was performed to obtain epoxy-DTMP-lignin. For comparison, we introduce a rigid structure by the annulation of C2-acetals to obtain epoxy-annulated lignin. The glass transition temperatures of epoxy-DTMP-lignin and epoxy-annulated lignin obtained by differential scanning calorimetry were 94 °C and 134 °C, respectively, demonstrating the achievement of the precise thermodynamic properties of lignin-based epoxy resins expected based on their structural design.\n",

      "The [RuCl_{3}(PCy_{3})_{2}] complex presented high reactivity toward ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornadiene (NBD) in a non-degassed solution upon addition of ethyl diazoacetate (EDA). Quantitative yields of polyNBD were obtained instantaneously at 25 °C. ROMP of norbornene (NBE) occurred better at 50 °C for 60 min, with 95 % of isolated polyNBE. Copolymers with different porous structures were obtained from ROMP of NBE in the presence of NBD with different starting [NBE]/[NBD] molar ratios at 25 °C. SEM micrographs showed a more organized porous structure as the NBD loading decreased. A well-defined honeycomb-like pattern was recorded for the copolymer from the run with an NBE:NBD molar ratio load of 5000:500. The T_{g} values varied from 37 °C in polyNBE to 90 °C in poly[NBE-co-NBD] as the NBD loading increased.\n",

      "Isosorbide monoacrylate (IMA) is a fully bio-based monomer formed by the reaction between isosorbide and acrylic acid. From a fundamental point of view and as a potential substitute for the current petro-based and carcinogenic monomers, it is crucial to understand its behaviour during a conventional radical polymerization. To this end, the radical polymerizability of IMA has been investigated in depth under various conditions (ie different solvents or [IMA]/[Initiator(AIBN)] ratios). In all cases, plateaus are reached for M_{n}. The Mayo method of IMA free radical polymerization was carried out and the transfer to monomer (C_{tr}M) constant was determined to be up to 1.4 x 10^{-3}. Depending on the molecular weight, PIMA with a large range of T_{g} from room temperature to higher than 100 °C could be obtained. Furthermore, the treatment of high-T_{g} PIMA with succinic anhydride leads to a high-performance thermoset featuring thermomechanical properties close to those of commercial epoxy resins such as DGEBA-based resins (T_{g} = 116 °C and E' = 4 GPa).\n",

      "Two series of α-1,3-glucan with branched and linear mixed ester side chains, namely α-1,3-glucan pivalate hexanoate (α-1,3-glucan-Pi-Hex) and α-1,3-glucan isobutyrate hexanoate (α-1,3-glucan-iBu-Hex), were synthesized as biomass-based thermoplastic resins via an enzymatic polymerization and a heterogeneous chemical esterification using trifluoroacetic acid anhydride and carboxylic acids. The degree of substitution (DS) ratio of two types of ester groups was precisely controlled by adjusting the initial dosages of the two corresponding carboxylic acids. Although α-1,3-glucan homobranched esters, ie, α-1,3-glucan pivalate and α-1,3-glucan isobutyrate, were crystalline and their cast films were brittle, the cast films of the mixed esters gradually lost crystallinity and finally became amorphous in proportion to increasing DS of hexanoate (DS_{Hex}), and their flexibility improved significantly. Specifically, α-1,3-glucan-Pi-Hex and α-1,3-glucan-iBu-Hex with DS_{Hex} = 1.5 had high film flexibilities and high glass-transition temperatures of 120 and 93 °C, respectively. These are comparable to the properties of conventional oil-based amorphous plastics such as polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate). The processing window widened with increasing DS_{Hex}, which led to less thermal decomposition during thermal processing. The mixed ester method was effective for controlling the physical properties of α-1,3-glucan esters. Furthermore, α-1,3-glucan-Pi-Hex and α-1,3-glucan-iBu-Hex showed promise as transparent and flexible films with high thermal stability for electric devices of designability.\n",

      "Polyelectrolyte solution dynamics have been carefully studied experimentally and theoretically for unentangled solutions and thought to be reasonably well understood. While theoretical models have been proposed for entangled polyelectrolyte solutions, there have been limited experimental data published to justify any understanding of entangled polyelectrolyte solution rheology. Herein, we study entangled nearly monodisperse carefully dialyzed caesium polystyrene sulfonate (M_{n} = 2.83 x 10^{6} g/mol) solutions without salt in water, anhydrous ethylene glycol (T_{g} = -95 °C), and anhydrous glycerol (T_{g} = -80 °C) using rotational rheometry and X-ray scattering to determine the correlation length. For the glycerol solutions, time-temperature superposition was found to work between 25 and -5 °C, yielding linear viscoelastic (LVE) response of polyelectrolyte solutions over a wide frequency range. At concentrations where scaling predictions expect entanglements, the LVE response appears unentangled (no rubbery plateau), suggesting an underestimation of the entanglement concentration c_{e}. At higher concentrations in entangled solutions, the rubbery plateau width measured as the ratio of the two crossing points of storage and loss moduli (τ_{rep}τ_{e}) in glycerol scales as c^{4}, suggesting that polyelectrolyte solutions behave like solutions of neutral polymers in the entangled concentration regime. Four methods for evaluating entanglement concentration are compared, and their relative orderings are similar to those of neutral polymer solutions.\n",

      "High performance engineering thermoplastics exhibit excellent thermomechanical performance and chemical resistance, however, the rigid polymeric main chains that are derived from highly or fully aromatic repeating units impose processing challenges. The design of photo-reactive precursors now enables additive manufacturing of poly(amide imide) (PAI) precursor organo-gels via UV-assisted direct ink write (DIW) printing. Solution rheology revealed prerequisite high solution viscosities and shear thinning behavior of organic solutions of the PAI precursors. Additionally, photorheology of PAI precursors exhibited rapid gelation and high gel strengths, enabling production of self-supporting organo-gels that are necessary for successful DIW. Thermal post-treatment of the printed organo-gels revealed isotropic linear shrinkage as low as 26 % during drying and imidization. The reduced chain rigidity of the poly(amide imide), relative to fully-aromatic polyimides, prevented quantitative thermal removal of the poly (hydroxyethyl acrylate) (poly(HEA)) scaffold, resulting in a decreased glass transition temperature (263 °C) relative to commercial PAI (290 °C). Moreover, crosslinking of the PHEA during thermal imidization limited scaffold removal upon solvent extraction, however, suggested the formation of novel multiphase polymers. Selective dissolution of the PAI from the crosslinked PHEA enabled assessment of the role of the scaffold on thermomechanical properties and characterization of printed PAI. Spectroscopic and thermal analysis confirmed the formation of the desired PAI composition with this photochemical synthetic method.\n",

      "Polyimide (PI) films with ultralow coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and high glass transition temperature (Tg) are in great demand for applications as substrates in flexible displays. Furthermore, trade-off between CTE and toughness is highly concerned due to strategies for reducing CTE always result in weakness of toughness. In this work, we developed a facile method to improve dimension stability and toughness of PI containing benzimidazole units via regulating entanglement density based on controlling molecular weight and solid content of precursor polyamic acid (PAA) solution. As a result, the Tg of PI films increased from 394.3 to 441.4 °C and the in-plane CTE (40-350 °C) decreased from 65.7 to 3.9 ppm/K with entanglement density increasing from 253.3 to 2868.6 mol/m^{3}. Moreover, mechanical properties especially toughness of PI films were enhanced significantly (from 7 % to 18 %) as entanglement density increased. In short, we delineated the effects of entanglement on the properties of PI films and found that the decrease of CTE mainly arises from the increase of entanglement density. Our studies provide new insights into the future design of flexible PI substrates with low CTE.\n",

      "Resolving the relationships between the molecular structure and gas separation properties of microporous polymers and their derived carbon molecular sieve membranes (CMSMs) are extremely important in obtaining highly efficient gas separation polymer membranes and CMSMs. To elucidate the correlations, we designed two microporous polyimides (CTPI and MTPI) derived from two triptycene-based diamine isomer monomers, that is, 2,6-triptycene diamine (C_{2} symmetry, CTA) and 2,7-triptycene diamine (C_{s} symmetry, MTA). The MTA shows a higher dipole moment than CTA (2.47 vs 1.83 Debye). As a result, the MTPI derived from MTA exhibits a slightly higher density (1.25 vs 1.23 cm^{3} g^{-1}), smaller fractional free volume (0.250 vs 0.262), lower surface area (148 vs 193 m^{2} g^{-1}) and smaller micropore size (7.5 vs 9.0 Å), higher glass transition temperature (345.8 vs 329.3 °C) and lower gas permeability but a slightly higher gas pair selectivity than CTPI. The MTPI also demonstrates a higher maximum derivative of weight loss temperature (547.6 vs 546.4 °C) than CTPI, and the 550 °C pyrolyzed MTPI (MTPI-550) shows a higher surface area (772 vs 703 m^{2} g^{-1}) and larger micropore (6.4 vs 5.4 Å) than the corresponding CTPI-550. Consequently, the MTPI-550 shows higher gas permeability than CTPI-550. The CO_{2} permeability of MTPI-550 is 9878 Barrer combined with CO_{2}/CH_{4} ideal selectivity of 44.5, which is one of the best performances among reported CMSMs. The barometric sorption results indicate that the higher permeability of CMSMs than the PIM-PI precursors is due to the larger diffusion and solubility coefficients because of huge enhanced microporosity, and the higher selectivity is attributed to their diffusion selectivity by the smaller pore size of CMSMs. The above findings clearly show that the larger dipole moment isomer leads to a compacter polymer chain packing of the corresponding PIM-PI, and a more open structure in the resulting CMSM due to the larger dipole-dipole interaction delayed its decomposition speed during the CMSM formation.\n",

In addition to β-substituted acrylates, α-substituted acrylates (eg, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and n-butyl methacrylate (nBMA)) were examined as comonomers. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (^{1}H NMR) spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) characterizations of the obtained copolymers revealed that each monomer component was incorporated sufficiently. The thermal stabilities of the resulting copolymers were investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), indicating that the glass-transition temperature (T_{g}) of the copolymers can be widely varied over a relatively high-temperature range by selecting the optimal comonomer.

All the reactions proceeded quantitatively to give gel-free, soluble polymers in organic solvents. The number-average molecular weight (M_{n}) of the polymers increased in direct proportion to monomer conversion and further increased on addition of a fresh monomer feed to the almost completely polymerized reaction mixture. The contents of the unreacted vinyl groups in the produced soluble polymers were less than ~10 mol %, and therefore, the degree of cyclization of the polymers was determined to be over ~90 %. These facts show that cyclopolymerization of 1, 2, and 3 exclusively occurred and the poly(vinyl ether)s with the cyclized repeating units and polycyclic pendants were obtained with their molecular weights being regulated. BF_{3}OEt_{2} initiator also caused cyclopolymerization of 1, 2, and 3 to give the corresponding high-molecular-weight cyclopolymers quantitatively.

Dibutyltin oxide (DBTO) and titanium(IV) butoxide (TBT) catalysts were employed, and the resulting copolymers were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of each catalyst on the copolymerization. DBTO produced low molecular weight oligomers with M_{n} ranging from 2000 to 2500, whereas TBT produced high molecular weight copolymer M_{n} ranging from 8700~21900. GC-MS analysis was performed to identify the by-products during the transesterification process, and side reactions such as dehydration were observed, which were in good agreement with previous results showing the same by-product. The correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC), ^{1}H and ^{13}C NMR analyses revealed that the chain end of P13BCT_Sn was primarily composed of the vinyl end group rather than the hydroxyl group, which was a major contributor to the formation of low molecular weight polymers. The density of P13BCT slightly increased with the addition of 1,3-BD. The T_{g} of P13BCT decreased with 1,3-BD contents from 74 °C to 51 °C due to the enhanced flexibility of the main chain. The thermal stability of the copolyesters was determined using TGA in a nitrogen atmosphere. The copolyesters were stable up to 330-360 °C, and the decomposition temperature decreased as the 1,3-BD content increased.

The basic thermal behaviors, overall isothermal melt crystallization kinetics, crystal structure, spherulitic morphology and growth, thermal stability, and hydrolytic degradation of PBSub were systematically investigated for the first time. PBSub has a low glass transition temperature of about -61 °C, a melting point of 55.2 °C, and an equilibrium melting point of 61.4 °C. The overall isothermal melt crystallization kinetics of PBSub was investigated at different crystallization temperature values and analyzed by the Avrami equation. PBSub has an average Avrami exponent value of about 3, suggesting that the crystallization mechanism of PBSub may correspond to three-dimensional truncated sphere growth with athermal nucleation. An obvious spherulitic morphology was observed for PBSub, and the spherulitic growth rates decrease with increasing crystallization temperature. PBSub exhibits a crystallization regime II to regime III transition on the basis of the secondary nucleation theory. The crystal structure study reveals that PBSub is highly crystalline, presenting strong diffraction peaks and a great crystallinity of about 55 %. The thermogravimetric analysis study demonstrates that PBSub has both a high decomposition temperature at 5 wt % weight loss of about 377 °C and a high temperature at the maximum degradation rate of about 421 °C, suggesting its good thermal stability.

The amount of trans-connected monomer units is found to rise with decreasing polymerization temperature and with increasing molecular weight to a limiting value of about 95 % at 25 kg/mol.

Both the triblock copolymers were melt-quenched to -40 °C to prepare the amorphous samples. The melt morphology of the triblock copolymers was preserved upon cooling the melt to -40 °C. PLLA and PDMS blocks are immiscible in the melt, and the amorphous triblock copolymer shows two distinct glass transition temperatures (T_{g}) on heating. On the other hand, PLLA and PEG segments are miscible and the triblock copolymer shows the single T_{g}. Structural evolution of PLLA during heating of the amorphous ABA triblock copolymers has been investigated by measuring the variable temperature small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) and FTIR spectra. In the case of PLLA-b-PDMS-b-PLLA triblock copolymer (immiscible system), the mesophase of PLLA was found to appear just above the T_{g} of PLLA block (~45 °C), and on further heating the mesophase changed to the regular α form at around 90 °C. On the other hand, in PLLA-b-PEG-b-PLLA (miscible system), the mesophase of PLLA was found to appear at lower temperature ie -20 °C, because of the enhanced molecular mobility of PLLA chains in the presence of PEG. However, irrespective of the mesophase formation temperature, the ordered α form has appeared at around 90 °C. In this way, during heating of the amorphous triblock copolymers, the PLLA block was found to crystallize into the ordered α form always through the mesophase just above the T_{g} of PLLA.

The mean-field segmental interaction parameter is determined to be χ _{EO/St}=-7.05x10^{-3}+21.3/T, based on the SAXS scattering intensity analysis for T>T_{MF} (crossover temperature from the concentration-fluctuation region to the mean-field region). Using real-time resolved simultaneous SAXS and WAXD techniques, the PEO block is observed to crystallize within the confined lamellae provided by the glassy PS layers. The crystal (the c-axis) orientation within the confined lamellae is determined by combined two-dimensional (2D) SAXS and WAXD experiments. The PEO crystals are observed to tilt away from the lamellar surface normal (n) at T_{c}<35 °C, while they are oriented parallel to n when crystallized above 35 °C. The thickness changes in the lamellar phase morphology after isothermal crystallization can also be observed when compared with that in the molten state using 1D SAXS. After the crystallization of PEO blocks, the phase lamellar thickness slightly decreases with decreasing T_{c} when T_{c}<35 °C. When T_{c}>35 °C, the lamellar thickness slightly increases with increasing T_{c}. At T_{c}=35 °C, the thickness remains identical to that in the molten state. The increase of phase lamellar thickness may be a result of both dimensional change of the crystal growth via thickening of PEO lamellar crystals, and weakening of the confinement of the PS glass layers. The isothermal crystallization kinetics and melting results observed in DSC also support these conclusions.\n",

      "Polymer extrusion additive manufacturing processes, such as fused filament fabrication (FFF), are now being used to explore the fabrication of thin films and membranes. However, the physics of molten polymer extrusion constrains achievable thin film properties (eg, mechanical isotropy), material selection, and spatial control of film composition. Herein, we present an approach for fabrication of functional polymer thin films and membranes based on the microextrusion printing of polymer solutions, which we refer to as \"solvent-cast printing\" (SCP). Constructs fabricated via SCP exhibited a 43 % reduction in anisotropy of tensile strength relative to those fabricated using FFF. The constructs fabricated via SCP exhibited a lesser extent of visible layering defects relative to those fabricated by FFF. Further, the swelling dynamics of the films varied depending on the membrane fabrication technique (ie, SCP vs manual drop casting). The opportunity for expanding material selection relative to FFF processes was demonstrated by printing poly(benzimidazole), a high-performance thermoplastic with high glass-transition temperatures (T_{g} ~ 400 °C). Results from this work indicate that our new approach could facilitate the manufacture of mechanically isotropic thin films and membranes using currently unprintable high-performance thermoplastics.\n",

      "We employed a low-cost solution-processed ultrathin insulating polymeric layer of poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS), with a high glass transition temperature (T_{g} ~ 185 °C), as an interfacial layer between the polymer:fullerene photoactive layer and the Al negative electrode for enhancing device power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells and investigated the roles of the interfacial nanolayer by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy and capacitance-voltage measurement. The thin polymeric layer forms a dipole layer and causes the vacuum level of the adjacent negative electrode to shift upward, which resulted in an increase of the built-in potential. As a result, the open-circuit voltage and PCE of the device using a PHS nanolayer were remarkably improved. We finally achieved a very high PCE of 6.5 % with the PHS/Al negative electrode which is even much better than that of the device using an Al electrode (5.0 %). The solution-processed inexpensive PHS layer with a high T_{g} can be an attractive alternative to conventional vacuum-deposited low-work-function metal and insulating metal fluoride interfacial layers.\n",

      "This work describes the melting and polymorphic behavior of poly(decamethylene terephthalamide) (PA 10T). Both solution-crystallized (SC) and melt-crystallized (MC) PA 10T show double melting endotherms in DSC. The SC crystal form melts at 260-300 °C giving the first melting endotherm, and meanwhile undergoes a polymorphic transition forming the MC crystal form. The subsequent melting of the MC crystal form gives the second melting endotherm at 300-325 °C. This irreversible polymorphic transition is confirmed by variable-temperature WAXD and IR. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) shows a glass transition temperature (T_{g}) at 127 °C and the presence of an α' transition at 203 °C (0.1 and 1 Hz). This transition could be confirmed by DSC and variable-temperature WAXD experiments. The α' transition correlates with a reversible thermal process and a sudden change in intersheet spacing.\n",

      "Model samples of polyethylene (PE) with different degrees of branching (up to seven side groups, mostly of butyl type, at 100 C) are melt-crystallized at two undercoolings, 10 and 68 °C, in order to obtain samples with various crystalline structures. The last is verified by the observation that the commonly reported equilibrium melting point T_{m} ^{∞} of PE is again obtained via extrapolation to infinitely large crystals from both small-angle X-ray scattering and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements. The samples are also characterized with respect to their density and microhardness (H). The very strong effect of crystallinity and crystal sizes on H is clearly demonstrated. It is emphasized that the crystal size effect reflects rather the effect of crystal perfection, ie packing density. Via extrapolation of H the equilibrium microhardness of PE crystals Hc∞=160MPa is determined. It is also shown that H vanishes when the crystal size approaches 27 Å. Using the recently derived analytical expression for T_{g} and H, the T_{g} of completely amorphous samples of PE is calculated and a value of -25 °C is obtained which agrees with the reported highest values for T_{g} of PE. In addition, a simple equation for the calculation of H from the paracrystalline lattice distortions g (hk0) is proposed (H=H_{c}^{id}-kg (hk0)), provided the structure of the crystallites can be described by the one-phase paracrystalline concept. Finally, in addition to previous results on other systems, it is demonstrated that the application of the additivity law to multicomponent and/or multiphase systems is justified only in the case when all components (phases) have a melting or glass transition temperature (T_{m},T_{g}) above the temperature at which the H-measurements are carried out. In the case where the system contains a liquid-like component (phase), its contribution to the overall H is by changing the deformation mechanism and in order to apply the additivity law, H must be expressed as H = 1.97T_{g}-571.\n",

      "In this report, a dipolar glass polymer, poly(2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl methacrylate) (PMSEMA), was synthesized by free radical polymerization of the corresponding methacrylate monomer. Due to the large dipole moment (4.25 D) and small size of the side-chain sulfone groups, PMSEMA exhibited a strong γ transition at a temperature as low as -110 °C at 1 Hz, about 220 °C below its glass transition temperature around 109 °C. Because of this strong γ dipole relaxation, the glassy PMSEMA sample exhibited a high dielectric constant of 11.4 and a low dissipation factor (tan δ) of 0.02 at 25 °C and 1 Hz. From an electric displacement-electric field (D-E) loop study, PMSEMA demonstrated a high discharge energy density of 4.54 J/cm^{3} at 283 MV/m, nearly 3 times that of an analogue polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). However, the hysteresis loss was only 1/3-1/2 of that for PMMA. This study suggests that dipolar glass polymers with large dipole moments and small-sized dipolar side groups are promising candidates for high energy density and low loss dielectric applications.\n",

VBOZO underwent free radical polymerization initiated by azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) to form a homopolymer P(VBOZO) with a number-average molecular weight of about 5050 g mol^{-1}. Meanwhile the benzoxazine group remains unchanged in the copolymer and can undergo cationic polymerization at high temperature to form crosslinked polymers. Benzoxazine-containing linear P(VBOZO) has a T_{g} of about 125 °C and shows much better thermal stability than polystyrene. The peak temperature assigned to the cationic ring-opening polymerization of P(VBOZO) was centered at 263.0 °C. The VBOZO also copolymerized with styrene under free radical conditions to get the copolymer P(VBOZO-co-St). The polymerization character of VBOZO is very similar to styrene and the copolymer composition is very close to the feed ratio of monomers.

In the second case, 2-(6-hydroxynaphthalene-2-yl)-2-oxazoline (5) was used as AB-type monomer in thermally induced polymerizations. The time dependences of polyadditions in bulk as well as in the solution were examined. The reduction of molar mass was observed after the initial fast increase of molar mass. This can be explained by the presence of side and degradation reactions. In both cases, polyadditions resulted in the linear poly(ether amide)s, which were characterized by ^{1}H and ^{13}C NMR spectroscopy. Thermal properties of the prepared polymers were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Comparison of the temperatures of glass transition for polymers prepared in AA + BB mode shows the strong dependence of thermal properties on the structure of the polymers. The values were in the range of 136-171 °C. The glass-transition temperature (T_{g}) of poly[2-(6-hydroxynaphthalene-2-yl)-2-oxazoline] prepared by AB-type polyaddition is 183 °C, which corresponds to the higher contents of hard aromatic segments in the latter type of polymers compared to the polymers prepared in the AA + BB-type polyadditions.

In this step, co-catalyst systems of Zn(AcO)_{2}/Ge(OBu)_{4} and Zn(AcO)_{2}/Ti(BuO)_{4} are effective for obtaining PPS having middle molecular weights (>10.0 kDa). This middle-molecular-weight PPS is chain-elongated in the third-step polycondensation with Zn(AcO)_{2} as the catalyst to obtain a molecular weight reaching 120 kDa.

      "Poly(chloro-p-xylylene) thin films are shown to have a changing morphology as a function of deposition temperature from spectroscopic ellipsometry and X-ray diffraction measurements. At lower deposition temperatures, the as-deposited polymer exhibited negative birefringence attributed to the presence of amorphous conformationally disordered polymer chains. As the deposition temperature was increased the polymer chains became more conformationally ordered resulting in an increase in the thin film's birefringence. At higher deposition temperatures, above the polymer's T_{g} evidence of crystallinity was apparent from X-ray diffraction results. The increase in the thin film's birefringence may be attributed to the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization causing the plane of the phenyl group to orient more perpendicular to the plane of the substrate, evidently the more stable conformation for poly(chloro-p-xylylene). After an inert post-deposition anneal at 210 °C for 2 h, the thin films deposited at lower temperatures showed evidence of higher crystal quality than the above T_{g} deposited films because of a smaller d-spacing. A decrease in the full width half max of the X-ray diffraction peak was attributed to a large increase in the crystallite size, larger for the films deposited at higher temperatures as a result of a greater degree of crystallinity present in those films as-deposited. Further, comparisons are made between the as-deposited and post-deposition annealed samples in terms of stress, crystalline disorder and crystallite size. In addition, from differential scanning calorimetry measurements, the glass transition temperature of poly(chloro-p-xylylene) was 35 °C-36 °C and 44 °C at heating rates of 0.2 °C/min and 5 °C/min.\n",

      "The photosensitized degradation of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) via an anionic reaction process was studied using spectrophotometry, electron spin resonance (ESR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements. PLA film doped with N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) was irradiated at 77 K using UV light (λ_{c} = 356 nm) by which the PLA matrix itself cannot be directly excited. After photoirradiation, a new broad absorption band appeared over the original spectrum due to TMPD^{+} *, which was produced by two-photon ionization. The ESR spectrum of the irradiated sample indicated the presence of the TMPD^{+} * radical and main-chain scission radical of PLA. During the thermal annealing at 0 °C, the latter radical changed to another radical species by dehydrogenation of the alpha hydrogen of the PLA main chain. TMPD^{+} * was extremely stable at room temperature for 7 d. However, by thermal annealing at 40 °C, all the radicals decayed due to the enhanced molecular motions near T_{g} of PLA (58.7 °C). Spectral simulation for the obtained ESR spectra revealed the relative amounts of four radicals: TMPD^{+} *, a main-chain scission radical, a main-chain tertiary radical, and an unknown radical. The last one was tentatively assigned to the PLA radical anion because of its short decay time. GPC measurements clearly indicated a decrease in the molecular weight of PLA after irradiation.\n",

      "A novel class of carbazole polymers, nitrogen-linked poly(2,7-carbazole)s, was synthesized by polycondensation between two bifunctional monomers using the palladium-catalyzed amination reaction. The polymers were characterized by ^{1}H NMR, Infrared, Gel permeation chromatography, and MALDI-TOF MS and it was revealed that the combination of the monomer structures is important for producing high molecular weight polymers. Thermal analysis indicated a good thermal stability with high glass transition temperatures, eg, 138 °C for the higher molecular weight polymer P2. To pursue the application possibilities of these polymers, their optical properties and energy levels were investigated by UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra as well as their electrochemical characteristics. Although the blue light emission was indeed observed for all polymers in solution, the quantum yields were very low and the solid films were not fluorescent. On the other hand, the HOMO levels of the polymers estimated from the onset potentials for the first oxidation in the solid thin films were relatively high in the range of -5.12 to -5.20 eV. Therefore, light emitting diodes employing these polymers as a hole-transport layer and iridium(III) complex as a triplet emitter were fabricated. The device of the nitrogen-linked poly(2,7-carbazole) P3 with p,p'-biphenyl spacer, which has a higher HOMO level and a higher molecular weight, showed a much better performance than the device of P2 with m-phenylene spacer.\n",

      "Nonelastic deformation of semicrystalline poly(butylene terephtalate) (PBT) was investigated by calorimetric measurements and strain-recovery tests. Differential scanning calorimetry on PBT specimens deformed both below and above their glass-transition temperature (T_{g} ≈ 50 °C) showed the presence of a broad exothermal peak whose area represents the energy released for the nonelastic strain recovery. This energy became more and more pronounced as the strain level increased, and it decreased as the deformation temperature increased, even if a significant contribution was detected on specimens deformed at temperatures much higher than T_{g}. For two temperature conditions (21 and 100 °C), strain-recovery master curves were built showing the following two distinct deformation components: one recoverable with time and another one irreversible, this latter one arising from relatively low levels of strain. The recoverable component can be erased by heating the material at temperatures much higher than its T_{g}, close to the onset of the melting process. On the other hand, the irreversible strain component does not recover even if the material is brought close to the onset of the crystals melting. The shift factor for the strain-recovery master curves was compared with the shift factor for the construction of the dynamic storage modulus master curve obtained in the linear viscoelastic regime (small strain).\n",

      "The heat capacity of poly(oxyethylene) (POE) with a molar mass of 900,000 Da has been analyzed with differential scanning calorimetry and quasi-isothermal, temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry. The crystal structure, lattice parameters, and coherently scattering domain sizes have been measured with wide-angle X-ray diffraction as a function of temperature. The high-molar-mass POE crystals are in a folded-chain macroconformation and show some locally reversible melting starting already at about 250 K. At 335 K, the thermodynamic heat capacity reaches the level of the melt. The reversible crystallinity depends on the modulation amplitude and has been varied in the melting range from ±0.2 to ±3.0 K. Before melting, there is neither a change in the crystal structure nor a change in the domain size, but the expansivity of the crystals increases at about 320 K. These observations support the interpretation that the monoclinic POE crystals possess a glass transition temperature with a midpoint at about 324 K, whereas the maximum melting temperature is 341 K.\n",

      "Polyamide-6 1022B from Toyota was studied in the solid and molten state at T = 300-600 K and P = 0.1-190 MPa. Its PVT behavior in the molten and solid state was measured following the isothermal standard procedure, scanning all P-levels before increasing T to the next level. The total run time of a single experiment was 23 to 45 h. The results were analyzed using the Simha-Somcynsky (S-S) equation of state (eos) for the melt and Midha-Nanda-Simha-Jain (MNSJ) eos for the crystalline phase. In the molten state the theoretical description provided excellent fit to the PVT surface with ± 0.0003 mL/g residuals of the specific volume, yielding the characteristic reducing parameters, P*, V*, T*, the L-J interaction parameters, ε* and v*, as well as the free volume function, h = h(V, T). The PVT discontinuity in the melting region was characterized by three parameters: T_{m}, ΔT_{m}, and ΔV_{m}--the latter measuring the width and height of the first order transition. All three depend on P, as expected, T_{m} increased with P, whereas the two others decreased. Although the T_{m} value at ambient P was comparable to the values cited by literature, its pressure gradient was significantly lower than that reported for isobaric crystallization. Apparently, the pressure dilatometer detected constant volume before PA-6 reached maximum crystalline morphology. For PA-6, the glass transition is weak and vitreous region starts at the relatively low temperature, T_{g} = 316 ± 2 K, increasing with P at low rate of 0.1 K/MPa. In consequence, the solid-state data were only analyzed within the temperature range T_{g} <= T <= T_{m} where two phases coexist--crystalline solid dispersed in liquid PA-6. During the PVT measurements, there is continuous change of the dynamic equilibrium between these phases, related to crystal annealing, pressure crystallization and premelting in the vicinity of the T_{m} region. It has been found that the MNSJ theory cannot correctly reproduce the observed behavior in the solid state, for example, the predicted isobaric volume increase with T is smaller than observed (this behavior is in contrast with that reported by the authors for polyethylene). As a result, the solid-state PVT data were analyzed assuming that the behavior is a consequence of additive changes of the two phases, crystalline and molten; this approach leads to a reasonable description of the recorded data for PA-6. In addition to the fundamental analysis of the PVT data, the derivative functions, the thermal expansion coefficient, α = α(T, P), and the compressibility coefficient, κ = κ(T, P), were computed. For PA-6, these two functions show surprisingly different behavior, while the isobaric values of κ increased in the solid and molten phase seemingly following the same, nearly linear dependence, α was discontinuous at the melting region, having higher values below T_{m} than above. The mechanism responsible for such behavior may be related to the free volume increase caused by premelting. The statistical thermodynamics of the liquid state predicts that α should be significantly more sensitive to free volume than κ.\n",

      "Poly(ethylene naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate) has been uniaxially stretched at different draw ratios and at two different temperatures below and above its glass transition (T_{g} ~ 120 °C) respectively, at 100 and 160 °C. Crystallinity has been evaluated from calorimetric analyses and compared to the values deduced by FTIR spectroscopic data. As expected, the obtained results are quite similar and show that films stretched at lower temperature (100 °C) are more crystalline than those stretched at 160 °C. Optical anisotropy associated with orientation has been evaluated by birefringence and show that films stretched at 100 °C are more birefringent than those stretched at 160 °C as a result of a higher chain relaxation above T_{g}. Polarized FTIR was also performed to evaluate the individual orientation of amorphous and crystalline phases by calculating dichroic ratios R and orientation functions <P_{2}(cos θ)> and also show that amorphous and crystalline phases are more oriented in the case of films stretched below T_{g}. Nevertheless, the orientation of the amorphous phase is always weaker than that of the crystalline phase. Films stretched at 100 °C show a rapid increase in orientation (and crystallinity) with draw ratio and <P_{2}(cos θ)> reaches a limit value when draw ratio becomes higher than 3.5. Films drawn at 160 °C are less oriented and their orientation is increasing progressively with draw ratio without showing a plateau. A careful measurement of the IR absorbance was necessary to evaluate the structural angles of the transition moments to the molecular chain axis.\n",

In a lap-shear joint geometry, strength develops in all cases with time to the fourth power, which indicates that it is diffusion controlled. Strength developing at short times at the polydisperse PS/PS interface, at 90 °C, is higher than that at the monodisperse interface, at 92 °C (at T_{g} - 13 °C in both cases), presumably due to the contribution of the low molecular weight species. The decrease of strength at the PS/PPO interface when the bonding temperature decreases from 113 to 70 °C, ie, from T_{g} + 10 °C to T_{g} - 33 °C of the bulk PS, indicates a high molecular mobility at the surface as compared to that in the bulk, and can be expressed by a classical diffusion equation, which is valid above T_{g} (of the surface layer).\n",

      "Positron lifetime measurements, performed in the temperature range 80-300 K, are reported for polyethylene (PE) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The lifetime spectra have been analyzed using the data processing routines LIFSPECFIT and MELT. Two long-lived components appear, which are attributed to pick-off annihilation of ortho-positronium in crystalline regions and at holes in the amorphous phase. The ortho-positronium lifetimes, τ_{3} and τ_{4}, are used to estimate the crystalline packing density and the size of local free volumes in the crystalline and amorphous phases. The interstitial free volume in the crystals exhibits a weak linear increase with the temperature which is attributed to thermal expansion of the crystal unit cell. In the amorphous phase, the hole volume varies between 0.053 and 0.188 nm^{3} (PE) and between 0.152 and 0.372 nm^{3} (PTFE). Its temperature variation may be fitted by two straight lines, the intersection of which is used to estimate a glass transition temperature of T_{g} = 195 K for both PE and PTFE. The slopes of the free volume in the glassy and crystalline phases with the temperature correlate well with each other. The coefficients of thermal expansion of the hole volume are compared with the macroscopic volume change below and above the glass transition. From this comparison a fractional hole volume at T_{g} of 4.5 (PE) and 5.7 % (PTFE) and a number of 0.73 (PE) and 0.36 (PTFE) x 10^{27} holes/m^{3} is estimated.

      "The isothermal crystallization kinetics of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) have been investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized light microscopy (PLM). Enthalpy data of exotherm from isothermal crystallization were analyzed using the Avrami theory. The average value of the Avrami exponent, n, is about 2.8. From the melt, PTT crystallizes according to a spherulite morphology. The spherulite growth rate and the overall crystallization rate depend on crystallization temperature. The increase in the spherulitic radius was examined by polarized light microscopy. Using values of transport parameters common to many polymers (U* = 1500 cal/mol, T_{∞}= T_{g} - 30 °C) together with experimentally determined values of T (248 °C) and T_{g} (44 °C), the nucleation parameter, k_{g}, for PTT was determined. On the basis of secondary nucleation analyses, a transition between regimes III and II was found in the vicinity of 194 °C (ΔT ≅ 54 K). The ratio of k_{g} of these two regimes is 2.1, which is very close to 2.0 as predicted by the Lauritzen-Hoffman theory. The lateral surface-free energy, σ = 10.89 erg/cm^{2} and the fold surface-free energy, σ_{e} = 56.64 erg/cm^{2} were determined.

      "Poly(vinylamine), PVA, complexes with cobalt chloride hexahydrate exhibit a 45 °C enhancement in the glass-transition temperature per mol % of the d-block metal cation. Poly(ethylene imine), PEI, complexes with CoCl_{2}(H_{2}O)_{6} exhibit a 20 °C enhancement in T_{g} per mol % Co^{2+}. Since the basicities of primary and secondary amines are comparable (ie, pK_{b,PVA} ≈ 3.34 vs. pK_{b,PEI} ≈ 3.27) and the rates at which each polymeric ligand displaces waters of hydration in the coordination sphere of Co^{2+} are similar, transition metal compatibilization is operative in blends of both polymers with CoCl_{2}(H_{2}O)_{6}. These two polymers are immiscible in the absence of the inorganic component. Infrared spectroscopy suggests that nitrogen lone pairs in PVA and PEI coordinate to Co^{2+}. The stress-strain response of a 75/25 blend of PVA and PEI with 2 mol % Co^{2+} reveals a decrease in elastic modulus from 4.4 x 10^{9} N/m^{2} to 5.7 x 10^{7} N/m^{2}, a decrease in fracture stress from 3.7 x 10^{7} N/m^{2} to 2.0 x 10^{6} N/m^{2}, and an increase in ultimate strain from 1.3 to 12 % relative to the 75/25 immiscible polymer-polymer blend. A plausible explanation for this effect is based on the fact that cobalt chloride hexahydrate compatibilizes both polymers by forming a coordination bridge between nitrogen lone pairs in dissimilar chains. Hence, poly(ethylene imine), which is very weak with a T_{g} near -40 °C, is integrated into a homogeneous structure with poly(vinylamine) and the mechanical properties of the individual polymers are averaged in the compatibilized ternary complex\n",

The solid-state properties of poly(PDL) were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with mass spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), stress-strain measurements, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and dynamic mechanical and dielectric spectroscopies. Poly(PDL) is a crystalline polymer that melts around 100 °C. The polyester shows good thermal stability, with a main TGA weight loss centered at 425 °C. Because of the high degree of poly(PDL) crystallinity, the glass transition (-27 °C) is revealed by relaxation techniques such as dynamic mechanical and dielectric spectroscopies, rather than by DSC. In addition to the glass transition, the viscoelastic spectrum of poly(PDL) also shows two low-temperature secondary relaxations centered at -130 (γ) and -90 °C (β). They are attributed to local motions of the long methylene sequence (γ) and complex units involving water associated with the ester groups (β).

Their effectiveness was evaluated from polymerization rates, molecular weight control and dispersity (D) of the polymers. Thermal stabilities of the polymers were also examined. The monomers used were methyl methacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) and ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate (EBPADMA). RESULTS: Polymerization was accomplished at 70 and 130 °C in 5 min to 144 h. The value of D of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was 1.05-1.22. The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) for PMMA was 122-127 °C. The activity of the chain ends was established by chain extension and controlled polymerization was established by plotting M_{n} versus monomer conversion.

The TSDC spectra shows a prominent maxima around glass transition temperature (T_{g}) ie at 143 °C named as α-peak and the other peak is observed around 200 °C named as β-peak. The α-dipolar relaxation is taking place because of the movement of ketone (>C = 0) dipoles linked to the main chain. The β-peak is attributed to the space charges. It is observed that the magnitude of α-peak increases with the increase in poling field. The peak current and area under the α-peaks are found to be diminished with the increase of storage time (t_{s}) for electrets. The amplitude of α-peak decreases with the increase in thickness.

Moreover, unlike the immiscible PLA/PHB blends, the synthesized PHB-b-PLA block copolymer was miscible with the PLA, in which there was only one T_{g} in each of PLA/PHB-b-PLA blends. The T_{g} of the blend decreased with increasing the composition of PHB-b-PLA; and the T_{g}-composition relationship was fitted very well by both Fox's equation and Gordon-Taylor equation.\n",

      "PLLA is a thermoplastic biopolymer and can be used in industrial applications for medical and filtration applications. The brittleness of PLLA is attributed to slow crystallization rates and its glass transition temperature (Tg) is high (60 °C); for this reason, its applications are limited. The orientation, morphology, and crystal structure of the electrospun fibers was investigated by SEM, POM, DSC, FTIR, XRD, and SAXS. Combining with additives leads to a large decrease of fiber diameter, viscosity, and changes of fiber morphology and crystal structure compared to pure PLLA. DSC showed that the Tg of PLLA decreased about 15 °C and there was no change in relaxation enthalpy by the addition of plasticizer. FT-IR indicate a strong interaction between PLLA and additives; a new band appears in the PLLA blend at 1756 cm^{-1} at room temperature as a crystalline band without any annealing. In addition, WAXD indicated that the intensities of the two peaks at (200/110) and (203) increased for the blend at room temperature without any annealing in comparison with PLLA; this means that PHB crystallizes in the amorphous region of PLLA. The POM experiments agree with the results from DSC, FTIR, and WAXS measurements, confirming that adding PHB results in an increase in the number of nuclei with much smaller spherulites and enhances the crystallization behavior of this material, thereby improving its potential for applications.\n",

For this purpose, the prepared naphthalimide dye was added upon the polycondensation step and then a self-colored PET was prepared by step-growth polymerization. The characterization of synthesized self-colored PET and naphthalimide dye were carried out using TLC, FTIR, ^{1}HNMR, DSC, UV-visible and Fluorometery. Results indicated that, the novel fluorescent yellow-green PET with appropriate properties was obtained. The glass transition temperature of self-colored PET was 70 °C and it was measured by differential scanning calorimeter, which revealed that addition of dye to the chains of polymer did not affect the context of glass transition of polymer. UV-visible spectrum indicated that, 99 percent of dye was incorporated in polymer chains chemically. Furthermore, the intrinsic viscosity of self-colored PET was 0.556 dl/g and molecular weight of polymer was around 35000 (g/mol) and measured using the viscometer technique.\n",

      "Tissue engineering requires suitable polymeric scaffolds, which act as a physical support for regenerated tissue. A promising candidate might be polyurethane (PUR) scaffold, due to the ease of the PUR properties design, which can be adjusted directly to the intended purpose. In this study, we report a successful fabrication of porous polyurethane scaffolds (PPS) using solvent casting/particulate leaching technique combined with thermally induced phase separation. The obtained PPS had comparable chemical structure to native PUR, which was confirmed by FTIR and HNMR analyses. The performed DSC study determined a similar T_{g} of the obtained PPS to native PUR (-38 °C). The analysis of TEM micrographs revealed that PPS had a homogenous structure. The studied PPS interactions with canola oil, distilled water, saline solution and phosphate-buffered saline after 3 months of incubation revealed that these materials have stable character in these media. The significant decrease of contact angle from 68° for native PUR to 54° for PPS was noted, as well as the decrease of mechanical properties (T_{Sb} ~ 1 MPa and ε_{b} ~ 95 % of PPS were comparable to the native aorta tissue of T_{Sb} ~ 0.3-0.8 MPa and ε_{b} ~ 50-100 %). Through SEM analysis, the morphology of the PPS was determined: the porosity was 87 % and the pore sizes in the range of 98-492 um. The biological studies revealed that the obtained PPS are sensitive to microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli and that they are biocompatible with the 3T3 NIH cell line. In summary, the obtained PPS scaffolds may be a suitable material for soft tissue engineering like blood vessels.\n",

      "In this work, the synthesis and characterization of a new polymer, natural rubber-g-chitosan, from biopolymers available in nature is reported. In this process, soft and amorphous natural rubber (NR) is converted into a relatively more dimensionally stable new polymer (glass transition temperature changes from -68 to +94.5 °C), with versatile solubility in a variety of common organic solvents. For this purpose, mild epoxidation of NR is carried out to provide a reactive handle for the grafting of chitosan. Thus, chitosan-grafted natural rubber with different chitosan loading have been synthesized and characterized. The characterization of the new polymers revealed that the grafting process resulted in enhanced glass transition temperature in comparison to NR, remarkable improvement in thermal stability in comparison to NR and chitosan and the much needed solubility for the chitosan component, which is otherwise insoluble in common organic solvents. The NR-g-chitosan is fully amorphous in the solid state, similar to NR. These value-added characteristics promise the utility and processability of the newly synthesized materials in adhesives, packaging industries and in many other areas where natural rubber and chitosan are vitally employed.\n",

Herein, ZnO nanoparticles (NPs), CuO NPs, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets have been used as separate nanofillers in the formation of PVA nanocomposite films via solution casting approach. The prepared composite films were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and tensile strength testing. The results demonstrate the effect of various nanofillers on glass transition temperature (T_{g}), melting temperature (T_{m}), crystallization temperature (T_{c}), percentage crystallinity ( %χ_{c}) and tensile strength of composite films. A doping with (0.02 wt %) RGO nanosheets caused significant influence on thermal properties and tensile strength of PVA composite films as compared to other test nanofillers. The doping with RGO nanosheets resulted in elevation of T_{g} (48.2 °C), T_{m} (218.3 °C), T_{c} (157.8 °C) and %χ_{c} (41.9 %) as compared to that of pure PVA (T_{g} 38.4 °C, T_{m} 190.4 °C, T_{c} 115.1 °C and %χ_{c} 22.2 %).

      "In this work, dynamic mechanical properties of the grown bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibers were investigated. BC pellicles were fabricated using bacterial fermentation (Gluconacetobacter xylinus). The morphology results confirmed that the dried BC at ambient conditions could be categorized as a xerogel. The thermal dynamic mechanical analysis results indicated that the bound water in bacterial cellulose structure had a very significant effect on thermal and dynamic mechanical properties of BC pellicles. The results of dehydration kinetics study showed that the main mechanism governing water loss of BC was Fickian diffusion. The glass transition temperatures (T_{g}) of the BC dried at 25 °C (ambient temperature) and 105 °C were estimated - 33 and - 18 °C, respectively. This discrepancy can be attributed to the plasticizing effect of the bound water of BC dried at ambient temperature. Furthermore, the results indicated that its modulus drop smaller than one order of magnitude can be attributed to its high crystalline nature. The storage modulus versus frequency increased due to the limitation of the relaxation process of the polymer chains. Moreover, the relaxation time distribution was achieved from the slope of the modulus master curve versus logarithmic frequency. As a result, BC exhibited a solid-like behavior.\n",

      "Processing of a high glass transition (T_{g}) polymer such as polyethersulfone (PES; T_{g} = 225 °C) poses a challenge as it requires high processing temperatures or sometimes toxic solvents. In this work, we report of a facile process using superheated water (shH_{2}O) and supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO_{2}) co-media. PES solids were foamed in the scCO_{2}/shH_{2}O co-media or scCO_{2} alone in a batch process at different temperatures. The scCO_{2}/shH_{2}O produced a synergistic effect and achieved PES foams even at processing temperatures as low as 85 °C below the nominal T_{g}; whereas, scCO_{2} alone required higher processing temperatures. Moreover, the scCO_{2}/shH_{2}O co-media produced highly porous PES foams that were at least 23 % higher in porosity than what was obtained using scCO_{2} alone. In addition, the scCO_{2}/shH_{2}O produced open cell foams at some processing conditions; whereas, scCO_{2} produced closed cell morphologies. Since both CO_{2} and H_{2}O are innocuous, this approach has potential for use in the preparation of ultrafiltration membranes, which currently require the use of toxic solvents for their fabrication by way of the phase inversion process. Moreover, the use of scCO_{2}/shH_{2}O is a cost-effective approach for the processing of high T_{g} polymers at significantly lower temperatures. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 58:1108-1114, 2018.\n",

After each stabilization the specific retention volumes,, of probes were determined by using inverse gas chromatography (IGC) techniques for acetone, acetonitrile, p-xylene, n-propanol, pyridine, and n-hexane as probes in the temperature range 50-150 °C. When temperature changed from 150 to 275 °C specific retention volumes,, and values of probes were increased. Also, values of polar probes were higher than those of unpolar probes.

However, although full-field optical methods have been used in a wide range of areas and provide the advantages of high sensitivity and noncontact measurement, they have not been applied to characterize glass transition behavior for T_{g} measurement. Therefore, a full-field optical deflection measurement method, namely phase-stepping shadow moire (PSSM), was employed to observe the glass transition phenomenon of a polymer and determine its T_{g}. The resolution of the PSSM system applied for deflection measurement in this study was 1.56 μm. A polystyrene (PS) strip was employed to demonstrate the suitability of PSSM for T_{g} measurement. The results indicated that the glass transition of a PS strip could be clearly determined by PSSM; the T_{g} was found to be 98 °C, which is close to the measurement result of other presently used methods. Therefore, this study shows that PSSM is a viable, low-cost, and easy-to-use technique that can be used to measure the T_{g} of polymers.\n",

In addition, the presence of lignin (72 h of dissolution) led to a mat with an elongation at break of 149 ± 9 % compared to 14 ± 2 % for PET_{ref}.

Their thermal properties have been characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of P1 and P2 would be dependent on the polymer structure and were in the range of -27~-80 °C. The T_{g}s decreased considerably with an increase in the content of the siloxane main-chain groups and increased with higher content of phenyl groups. All of the copolymers showed good thermal stability, with their temperatures at 5 % weight loss (T_{d5}) being higher than 490 °C and char yields over 50 % under nitrogen. The chemistry of pyrolytic conversion was investigated by FT-IR, solid NMR and mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate that the cyclodisilazane group significantly alters the degradation behavior of the PDMS, modifying the profile of the thermal degradation and reducing the overall rate of volatiles evolution. The thermal stability and degradation behavior also indicate that the inter-molecular rearrangement occurs prior to the intra-molecular backbiting reactions by these OH-terminated copolymers. The thermolysis of the Si_{4}N_{2} groups in the backbone could bring the greater thermal stability to form the silicon-nitrogen networks via the consumption of Si-OH bonds. Retardation of the degradation rate is resulted from this cross-linking that prevents rearrangement of the siloxane to allow further depolymerization.\n",

The samples were removed from the boiling water every two hours for mechanical and dielectric characterization and color test. The dielectric measurements carried out on aged samples, up to 40 h, showed that the permittivity remained almost constant and its value was found to be 2.3 in the range -100 to +62.8 °C. However, as the temperature approaches the glass transition (T_{g} = 88.3 °C), the permittivity was observed to increase rapidly. It was also found that the permittivity of aged samples was lower than that of the non-aged samples. The dielectric loss factor (tan δ) measurements with respect to temperature have confirmed the presence of two relaxations: β at low temperature (around -35 °C) and α near the T_{g}. The combined action of water and temperature reduced the intensity of the corresponding relaxation peaks. The sample color index was evaluated up to 480 h using the SYNMERO scale in order to estimate the degradation extent.

The polymeric plasticizer is also able to contribute positively to the thermal stability and mechanical properties of the PVC films. Some of the advantages of incorporating polymeric plasticizer with high molecular weight includes lower rate of leaching from plastic, and improved tensile strength and elongation at break. Besides, thermal stability of the plastic studied using Kissinger's and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa's approaches shows that PVC blended with high molecular weight oil-modified polyester is more thermally stable, evidenced by the increase in the activation energy of decomposition, E_{d}.

The thermal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 130 °C for neat chitosan film, but the addition of SOR or GLY elicited a decrease in the temperature of the peak (120 °C). In addition, the antimicrobial activity of the chitosan films was evaluated against Listeria monocytogenes, and reached a reduction of 2 log after 24 h. The plasticizer concentration of 20 % GLY is sufficient for obtaining flexible chitosan films with good mechanical properties, and it could serve as an alternative as a packaging material to reduce environmental problems associated with synthetic packaging films.\n",

      "Ca/SBA-15 solid bases with different Ca/Si atomic ratios were prepared by a one-pot route and employed as catalysts for the production of poly(isosorbide carbonate) (PIC) from diphenyl carbonate and isosorbide via a transesterification polymerization process. The relationship between physicochemical properties and catalytic performance for Ca/SBA-15 in this melt process was investigated by means of various characterization techniques. It was found that basic site amount and strength were responsible for this transesterification process; the weak and medium basic sites inclined to promote polycondensation reaction. It was worth noting that strong basic sites could favor the decomposition of the resultant PIC, resulting in the decrease of weight-average molecular weight (M_{w}) and yield, and the sample with Ca/Si atomic ratio of 0.4 exhibited the best catalytic performance, giving PIC with M_{w} of 4.88 x 10^{4} g/mol and T_{g} of 169 °C at the optimal conditions. This excellent activity can be ascribed to the presence of rich basic sites and specific basic strength on the surface of 0.4Ca/SBA-15.\n",

Photophysical and thermal properties of the resulting polymeric emitter were fully characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). While P1 emits an orange-light centered at 567 nm in dilute tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, the solid powder of the polymer exhibits strong yellow emission peaked at 541 nm. It is also found that the as-synthesized polymer shows unique property of aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE). In addition, P1 possesses high thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (T _{d,5 %} of 430 °C and high morphological stability with a glass transition temperature (T_{g} of 171 °C. Under the stimulus of mechanical force, the emission of P1 can be changed from yellow to red (Δλ_{max} = 61 nm), showing a remarkable mechanochromism. The results from XRD analysis suggest that such mechanochromic phenomenonof P1 is probably caused by the destruction of crystalline structure, which leads to the conformational planarization of the distyrylanthracene moieties forming by the polymerization and the increase of molecular conjugation of the backbone.\n",

      "This paper is aimed at investigating the influence of temperature on mechanical properties and behavior of carbon fiber fabric reinforced polyphenylenesulfide (PPS) laminates subjected to different loadings: tensile, open hole tensile, in-plane shear, compressive, flexural, interlaminar shear, single-bolt double lap joint, and single-bolt single lap joint tests. The resulting experimental database is of the utmost importance for generating design allowables for structures integrating such thermoplastic-based composites. Depending on the test and the laminate's staking sequence, a temperature increase higher than the glass transition temperature (T_{g} = 98 °C of fiber fabric reinforced PPS laminates softens the matrix behavior and significantly degrades the quality of the adhesion at the fiber/matrix interface, resulting in reduced mechanical properties (in-plane shear, compressive, flexural and interlaminar shear). However, it does not seem to be detrimental for the tensile and the double lap joint's properties in quasi-isotropic laminates. In angle-ply laminates, the ductile behavior of the PPS matrix is exacerbated at high temperature resulting in larger plastic deformations and a lesser hole sensitivity of this material.\n",

      "We have explored semicrystalline poly(decamethylene terephthalamide) (PA 10T) based thermosets as single-component high-temperature (>200 °C) shape memory polymers (SMPs). The PA 10T thermosets were prepared from reactive thermoplastic precursors. Reactive phenylethynyl (PE) functionalities were either attached at the chain termini or placed as side groups along the polymer main chain. The shape fixation and recovery performance of the thermoset films were investigated using a rheometer in torsion mode. By controlling the M_{n} of the reactive oligomers, or the PE concentration of the PE side-group functionalized copolyamides, we were able to design dual-shape memory PA 10T thermosets with a broad recovery temperature range of 227-285 °C. The thermosets based on the 1000 g mol^{-1} reactive PE precursor and the copolyamide with 15 mol % PE side groups show the highest fixation rate (99 %) and recovery rate (>=90 %). High temperature triple-shape memory behavior can be achieved as well when we use the melt transition (T_{m} >= 200 °C) and the glass transition (T_{g} = ~125 °C) as the two switches. The recovery rate of the two recovery steps are highly dependent on the crystallinity of the thermosets and vary within a wide range of 74 %-139 % and 40-82 % for the two steps, respectively. Reversible shape memory events could also be demonstrated when we perform a forward and backward deformation in a triple shape memory cycle. We also studied the angular recovery velocity as a function of temperature, which provides a thermokinematic picture of the shape recovery process and helps to program for desired shape memory behavior.\n",

The glass transition temperature of NR block was found to be at about -64 °C, which is independent of the PPO whose transition is around 15 °C. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the thermal degradation of the samples proceeded in two steps characteristic of the immiscible components. The inability of PPO segments to provide physical crosslinking and the subsequent formation of hard domains is reflected in the low tensile properties and tear properties. The amorphous nature of the PPO phase and its immiscibility with NR phase are evidenced by the SEM studies. The effect of molecular weight of PPO as well as HTNR on the properties of the block copolymers has also been discussed.\n",

Previously, in PS/CNF(carbon nanofiber), a system with strong interfacial bonding, we found single glass transition temperature (T_{g}), which increases with wt % of CNF. Currently, in PS/SiO_{2} nano-composites, a weak interfacial interaction system, we found that there are two T_{g}s, one at 57^{o}C, which is lower than the PS bulk T_{g} (= 91 °C). The lower T_{g} is interpreted from the free volume in the weak bonding interface between PS and SiO_{2}. This result is consistent with our previous slow positron beam results of PS on Si substrate, which shows a significant lower T_{g} in the interface than in the bulk PS. (\n",

      "Thermoresponsive shape memory polymers (SMPs) are stimuli-responsive materials that return to their permanent shape from a temporary shape in response to heating. The design of new SMPs which obtain a broader range of properties including mechanical behavior is critical to realize their potential in biomedical as well as industrial and aerospace applications. To tailor the properties of SMPs, \"AB networks\" comprised of two distinct polymer components have been investigated but are overwhelmingly limited to those in which both components are organic. In this work, we prepared inorganic-organic SMPs comprised of inorganic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) segments of varying lengths and organic poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) segments. PDMS has a particularly low T_{g} (-125 °C) which makes it a particularly effective soft segment to tailor the mechanical properties of PCL-based SMPs. The SMPs were prepared via the rapid photocure of solutions of diacrylated PCL_{40}-block-PDMS_{m}-block-PCL_{40} macromers (m = 20, 37, 66, and 130). The resulting inorganic-organic SMP networks exhibited excellent shape fixity and recovery.

      "The modulus and glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of ultrathin films of polystyrene (PS) with different branching architectures are examined via surface wrinkling and the discontinuity in the thermal expansion as determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry, respectively. Branching of the PS is systematically varied using multifunctional monomers to create comb, centipede, and star architectures with similar molecular masses. The bulk-like (thick film) T_{g} for these polymers is 103 ± 2 °C and independent of branching and all films thinner than 40 nm exhibit reductions in T_{g}. There are subtle differences between the architectures with reductions in T_{g} for linear (25 °C), centipede (40 °C), comb (9 °C), and 4 armed star (9 °C) PS for ≈ 5 nm films. Interestingly, the room temperature modulus of the thick films is dependent upon the chain architecture with the star and comb polymers being the most compliant (≈2 GPa) whereas the centipede PS is most rigid (≈4 GPa). The comb PS exhibits no thickness dependence in moduli, whereas all other PS architectures examined show a decrease in modulus as the film thickness is decreased below ~40 nm. We hypothesize that the chain conformation leads to the apparent susceptibility of the polymer to reductions in moduli in thin films. These results provide insight into potential origins for thickness dependent properties of polymer thin films.\n",

      "Biodegradable polymer blends prepared by blending poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and corn starch do not form intact films due to their incompatibility and brittle behavior. For improving their compatibility and flexibility, poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) was grafted from the corn starch to prepare the PVAc-modified corn starch (CSV). The resulting CSV consisted of 47.2 wt % starch-g-PVAc copolymer and 52.8 wt % PVAc homopolymer and its structure was verified by FT-IR analysis. In comparison with 35 °C of the neat PVAc, the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of the grafted PVAc chains on starch-g-PVAc was higher at 44 °C because of the hindered molecular mobility imposed from starch on the grafted PVAc. After blending PHB with the CSV, structure and thermal properties of the blends were investigated. Only a single T_{g} was found for all the PHB/CSV blends and increased with increasing the CSV content. The T_{g}-composition dependence of the PHB/CSV blends was well-fitted with the Gordon-Taylor equation, indicating that the CSV was compatible with the PHB. In addition, the presence of the CSV could raise the thermal stability of the PHB component. It was also found that the presence of the PHB and PVAc components would not hinder the enzymatic degradation of the corn starch by α-amylase. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 55:1321-1329, 2015.\n",

      "We have studied glass transition temperature and thermal expansivity of polystyrene thin films supported on silicon substrate using X-ray reflectivity and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. In annealing experiments, we have found that the reported apparent negative expansivity of polymer thin films is caused by unrelaxed structure due to insufficient annealing. Using well-annealed films, we have evaluated glass transition temperature T_{g} and thermal expansivity as a function of film thickness. The glass transition temperature decreases with film thickness and is constant below about 10 nm, suggesting the surface glass transition temperature of 355 K, which is lower than that in bulk. We have also found that the thermal expansivity in the glassy state decreases with film thickness even after annealing. The decrease has been attributed to hardening of harmonic force constant arising from chain confinement in a thin film. This idea has been confirmed in the inelastic neutron scattering measurements.\n",

      "Polylactide (PLA) is an attractive candidate for replacing petrochemical polymers because it is biodegradable and produced from annually renewable resources. Characterized by high tensile strength, unfortunately the brittleness and rigidity of PLA limit its applicability. For a great number of applications such as packaging, fibers, films, etc, it is of high interest to formulate new grades with improved flexibility and better impact properties. In this objective, a specific PLA grade (L/D isomer ratio of 96:4, high molecular weight) was melt-mixed with selected plasticizers: bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DOA), glyceryl triacetate (GTA), and tributyl O-acetylcitrate (TBAC). Their effect on the molecular, thermal, and mechanical properties of PLA was investigated for content up to 20 wt % plasticizer and the results were correlated with a particular attention to the relationship between property and application. Using the solubility and interaction parameters, a tentative evaluation of the product that could act as the most effective plasticizer for PLA has been performed and the obtained results have been corroborated with the materials physical properties. Excellent mechanical performances were obtained using the plasticizer having the lowest molecular mass (GTA) and the best interaction parameter. In relation to plasticizer amount/nature, the glass transition temperature of PLA (62 °C) is decreased by plasticizing by more than 30 °C, whereas better impact properties and lower stiffness are measured. The optimal formulations targeted to the final applications are clearly characterized by specific end-use properties: improved crystallization rates (PLA-DOA); high elongation at break and tensile strength (PLA-GTA, PLA-TBAC), medium to high impact properties (PLA-DOA, PLA-GTA) compositions.

      "Tensile deformation behavior of amorphous Poly (1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene Terephthalate) (PCT) at 25 °C-108 °C was investigated by means of in situ synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). WAXS patterns were processed in a way that the scatterings from isotropic and anisotropic structures were separated. It turned out that the influences of temperature during deformation can be divided into three zones: below 80 °C, only molecular chains oriented; between 80 °C to 90 °C, very few imperfect crystals were induced by strain; above glass transition temperature (92 °C), the triclinic PCT crystalline structure began to form during deformation process. It was found that the Gaussian model of Haward and Thackray described the stress-strain behavior of the tensile stretched amorphous PCT very well. However, when being stretched above 80 °C, the system showed two characteristic network moduli because of strain-induced crystallization. The onset of change in network modulus occurred immediately after the formation of unoriented crystallites which served as physical cross-linking points to reinforce the material.\n",

Stable membranes with 9, 14, 24, 42 and 53 wt. % of IL were prepared via the solution casting procedure. Structural analysis (XRD, Raman, TGA and DSC) revealed that the increase of the incorporated IL content in PVA affected eg crystalline orientation in the diffraction plane 1 0 1 in favour of plane 2 0 0. The presence of the IL shifted the Tg (65 °C) and Tm (165 °C) of neat PVA to lower temperatures, towards the values of pure IL. The gas transport in neat PVA and PVA-IL blends with low IL content was found to be diffusivity-controlled, and the IL addition leads to an increase of both gas permeability and H_{2}/CO_{2} selectivity. Instead, membranes with an IL content above 20 wt. % were more permeable for CO_{2} due to the prevailing solubility-controlled mechanism. Compared to neat PVA, which has barrier properties, the sample PVA-IL with 53 wt. % of IL exhibited an exceptional increase in gas permeability for both gases, H_{2} circa 150 times to 8.65 Barrer and CO_{2} permeability circa 2400 times to 66.9 Barrer, with the corresponding ideal CO_{2}/H_{2} selectivity of 7.73 that slightly exceeds the reverse CO_{2}/H_{2} Robeson 2008 upper bound.\n",

We examined the effect of water on regenerated cellulose fibers in respect of the relaxation phenomenon and swelling behavior. The peaks and shoulder of mechanical loss tangent δ were observed at room temperature and water regains of 56-78 %. At the same time, the storage modulus markedly decreased around these water regains. Small angle X-ray scattering showed the maxima and shoulders in the wet state, which suggested that water decreased the density of the amorphous region and made space for the movement of polymer segments. It is possible that the glass transition temperatures of 510-550 K shift to room temperature at specific water regains. It is reasonable to suppose that water can penetrate into the amorphous region, loosening the interactions between cellulose molecules and widening the region, and in consequence decreasing the glass transition temperature.\n",

Three dielectric relaxations designated as α_{n}, α_{s}, and β are observed in order of decreasing temperature. The relaxation time for the α_{n} relaxation increases with increasing molecular weight and is assigned to the normal mode relaxation due to the component of dipole vector aligned in the direction parallel to the chain contour. The α_{s} relaxation is observed about 30 K above the glass transition temperature T_{g} (= 310 K) and is assigned to the local segmental mode due to the transverse component of the monomeric dipoles. The β relaxation is seen in the glassy state and is assigned to the secondary relaxation. From the relaxation strengths for the α_{n}, α_{s}, and β relaxations, the effective dipole moments for those relaxation processes are determined and compared with the parallel and transverse components of the dipole moment calculated theoretically with the semiempirical molecular orbital methods. The dielectric relaxation time for the normal mode increases with molecular weight M with the power of 3.5 in the range of molecular weight above the characteristic molecular weight M_{c} (= 13 000). The molecular weight between entanglements is calculated to be 7700 from the shear modulus in the rubbery plateau region.

The morphological structures in nanoscale thin films of PS_{214}-b-PMAPOSS_{27} and their temperature-dependent changes were investigated in detail by performing grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) with a synchrotron radiation source. GIXS formulas based on structural models were derived for the quantitative analysis of the two-dimensional (2D) scattering data. In addition, the thermal properties of the diblock copolymer were characterized: it was found to be stable up to 330 °C, and to undergo a glass transition at 96 °C (PS block) and a melting transition at 173 °C (PMAPOSS block). The quantitative 2D GIXS analysis found that the diblock copolymer molecules in the thin films undergo phase separation into PS and PMAPOSS domains, which generates a lamellar structure. Surprisingly, in the solvent-annealed films with and without subsequent thermal annealing the lamellar structure is completely oriented in the out-of-plane of the film and is stable up to the degradation temperature. The PMAPOSS layers in the lamellar structure were found to consist of two sublayers, namely a densely ordered layer composed of vertically oriented orthorhombic crystals and a less ordered layer that consists of molecularly stacked layers that are oriented vertically. In both the sublayers, the PMAPOSS block chains have helical conformations and thus are present as molecular cylinders. These molecular cylinders are always oriented in the film plane. On heating, the orthorhombic crystals and the molecularly stacked layers melt over the range 170-190 °C. On subsequent cooling, the orthorhombic crystals and molecularly stacked layers are not fully recovered, which indicates that the formation of orthorhombic crystals and stacked layers in the PMAPOSS domains requires thermal annealing.\n",

One limiting factor in the development of aliphatic polyesters as replacements for these materials has been their relatively low glass transition temperatures (T_{g}). For example, commercially available poly(lactic acid) has a T_{g} of approximately 60 °C. Epoxide/anhydride copolymerizations offer an alternative to the ring-opening polymerization of lactones for the synthesis of aliphatic polyesters and allow for tuning of polymer properties through two distinct monomer sets. We synthesized six partially or fully renewable tricyclic anhydrides and copolymerized them with propylene oxide (PO) and cyclohexene oxide (CHO). By varying both the epoxide and the anhydride, we were able to tune the T_{g} of the resulting polymers over a nearly 120 °C range from 66 °C to an exceptionally high 184 °C. Polymers produced with PO had a lower range of T_{g} values (66-108 °C) and higher molecular weights up to 32.2 kDa, while those produced with CHO had higher T_{g} values (124-184 °C) and lower molecular weights, showing the profound influence of both monomer sets.

      "The characteristic nanoscale dynamics of the alkyl side groups in the light-emitting polymer poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] have been investigated using quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS). The measurements were taken below the polymer's glass transition (T <= T_{g} ≃ 353 K), where the main backbone is in a rigid state and does not contribute to the broadening of the QENS signal. An analytical diffusion model consisting of a static term and two dynamical components, characterizing the flexible side groups, provide an excellent fit to the experimental data. The two observed dynamical processes are all localized in character, with no meaningful dependence on temperature. The faster process, with characteristic timescale of ~18 ps at room temperature (RT), can be linked to the average mobility of the terminal protons of the alkyl chain, while the slower process, with characteristic timescale of ~170 ps at RT, to those protons at the other end of the alkyl chain, closest to the backbone. While the fraction of mobile protons contributing to the QENS signal increases with increasing temperature, the characteristic timescale and confining volume within which the protons are able to move locally depend chiefly on the polymer conformational state.\n",

      "There is the need for novel polyelectrolytes with enhanced thermal and mechanical properties. In this report, we have reinforced a polyelectrolyte based on poly(dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate) (PDMAEM) using nanoclay montmorillonite (MMT), and have studied the thermal and viscoelastic properties. The protonated polymer (PDMAEMH) was solution mixed with functionalized MMT. Recognizing that the sort of surfactant may have a profound influence on the physical properties of the polymer matrix, neat MMT, and MMT treated with different surfactants (sulfobetaine and ammonia) were used, and the concentration of the nanofiller was varied from 1 to 5 %w/w. Strikingly, while PDMAEM exhibited a glass transition temperature T_{g} of 32 °C, the protonated PDMAEMH showed T_{g} = 155 °C. Master curves obtained by applying the time-temperature superposition principle showed that PDMAEM behaved predominantly elastic (G'' < G') suggesting an entangled polymer melt. However, PDMAEMH exhibited much longer relaxation times, a shift of ca. seven decades in frequency, suggesting that ionic interactions significantly hampered the molecular dynamics. X-ray scattering demonstrated that lower concentration and sulfobetaine surfactant favored exfoliation whereas ammonia and untreated MMT favored intercalation of the nanoplates. Furthermore, an enhancement in dynamic storage shear modulus was observed for the nanocomposites exhibiting intercalated morphologies relative to those displaying an exfoliated morphology. It is then suggested that the molecular dynamics is further slowed down due to confinement of the macromolecules between the nanoplates.\n",

      "In order to accomplish both phase and thermal stabilization of ammonium nitrate (AN), a new material has been developed, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-AN glass. PVP is capable of separating AN into its ions through an ion-dipole interaction with PVP. The ions remain separated below the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of PVP (~ 160 °C) which is confirmed by the disappearance of the solid-solid phase transitions associated with AN. Above the T_{g}, AN ions recombine, giving rise to a fast exothermic reaction. The material has been characterized by DSC, TGA, FTIR and quantum mechanical methods.\n",

      "A new naphthylamine-derived aromatic dicarboxylic acid, 1-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]naphthalene (2), was successfully synthesized by the sodium hydride-mediated condensation of 1-aminonaphthalene with 4-fluorobenzonitrile, followed by the alkaline hydrolysis of the intermediate dicyano compound 1. Four poly(amine-hydrazide)s were prepared from the polycondensation reactions of the dicarboxylic acid 2 and 4,4'-dicarboxytriphenylamine (2') with terephthalic dihydrazide (TPH) and isophthalic dihydrazide (IPH), respectively, via the Yamazaki phosphorylation reaction. The poly(amine-hydrazide)s were readily soluble in many common organic solvents and could be solution cast into transparent and flexible films with good mechanical properties. These hydrazide polymers had glass-transition temperatures (T_{g}) in the range of 182-230 °C and could be thermally cyclodehydrated into the corresponding oxadiazole polymers in the range of 300-400 °C. The resulting poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s had useful levels of thermal stability associated with high T_{g} (263-277 °C), 10 % weight-loss temperatures in excess of 500 °C, and char yield at 800 °C in nitrogen higher than 54 %. These polymers exhibited maximum UV-vis absorption at 344-391 and 352-391 nm in NMP solution and solid-state films, respectively. Their photoluminescence spectra in NMP solution showed maximum bands around 495-529 and 457-476 nm in the green and blue region for TPH and IPH series, respectively. The poly(amine-hydrazide) (IIPH) derived from diacid 2 and IPH showed a blue photoluminescence at 457 nm with full-width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 85 nm and exhibited a 34 % quantum yield in NMP solution. Blue electroluminescence characteristics were observed from the poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s of IIIIPH and III-TPH. Cyclic voltammograms of the poly(amine-hydrazide) films cast onto an indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate exhibited one oxidation redox couples (E_{onset}) at 1.11 V vs Ag/AgCl in dry acetonitrile solution, and revealed electrochromic characteristics with a color change from colorless to green at applied potentials switched between 0 and 1.6 V. The present study suggests that novel poly(amine-hydrazide)s and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s have a great potential as new blue-emitting materials with hole-transporting and electrochromic characteristics.\n",

      "We compare the influence of humidity on the polymer diffusion rate in films formed from two different polymer latex samples whose polymers have the same glass transition temperature (T_{g} ≈ 12 °C) but different hydrophilicity: poly(butyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate), P(BA-MMA), and the more hydrophobic poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate-co-tert-butyl methacrylate), P(EHA-tBMA). The diffusion process was monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) at 25 °C and at 0, 23, 54, 85 and 98 % relative humidities. The results show that the polymers diffused more rapidly in films aged at higher humidities, and thus were characterized by higher apparent diffusion coefficients (D_{app}). By performing a master curve analysis, we obtained humidity related shift factors (a_{H}). Not all the water taken up by these latex films contributes to enhance diffusion rates. Some of the water absorbed at high humidities is present in the form of water pools and microcavities (free water) and does not actively contribute to plasticization. We used FTIR spectra to obtain information about how water resides in the copolymer films. Although water is poorly miscible with most polymers, our results show that water molecules dispersed molecularly among the chains are highly efficient as a plasticizer and a promoter of polymer diffusion in latex films.\n",

      "Structural complexity inherited from a microbial synthesis of glycolipids was translated into unique poly(sophorolipid) biomaterials. ROMP polymerization of natural diacetylated lactonic sophorolipids gave a high molecular weight polymer with asymmetric bola-amphiphilic repeating units. The poly(sophorolipid) chain alternates C18 oleic-like aliphatic segments (90 % cis-configured double bonds) with bulky diacetylated disaccharide moieties. The solid-state properties were investigated by means of TGA, DSC, TMDSC, and variable-temperature X-ray diffraction. The poly(sophorolipid) is a solid at room temperature that undergoes the glass transition at 61 °C and melts at 123 °C. The crystal phase is associated with ordered packing of the aliphatic chain segments. The semicrystalline poly(sophorolipid) also displays a long-range order (d = 2.44 nm) involving sophorose groups that is found to persist after crystal phase melting (in high-T diffractograms) with a slightly shortened distance (2.27 nm). Upon annealing at 80 °C the poly(sophorolipid) recrystallizes and concomitantly the disaccharide units space out again at 2.44 nm. An exothermal phenomenon that immediately follows melting and is revealed by TMDSC might be associated with the observed adjustment of sophorose units spacing in the melt. The peculiar structural organization of this novel biomaterial is discussed.\n",

The homopolymers exhibited close to theoretical M_{n}'s, and the diagnostic M_{n}-conversion and first-order (ln[M]_{0}[M]-time) plots were linear; thus, chain transfer and termination were not detected. The propagating chain end of poly(pClαMeSt) was exceptionally stable; no decomposition could be detected even after 5 h under monomer-starved conditions. According to the ^{1}H NMR spectrum of homopoly(pClαMeSt), the polymer is 94 % syndiotactic; however, the precipitated polymer exhibited only a glass transition at 198 °C. Recrystallization from methylcyclohexane-methyl ethyl ketone solvent mixture yielded a semicrystalline polymer with T_{m} = 229 °C. Sequential block copolymerization of pClαMeSt with IB was also carried out by the addition of IB to the solution of living poly(pClαMeSt), followed by the addition of TiCl_{4}.

Effect of solvent and polymerization temperature on tacticity has been studied. The reactivity of IBMA is comparable to tert-butyl methacrylate (tBMA), and polymers of a very narrow molecular weight distribution (<1.10) have been synthesized at room temperature, in THF, in the presence of LiCl. The T_{g} of PIBMA is found to vary from 170 to 206 °C with chain tacticity.

The propeller-shaped triphenylamine units in the main chain and the rigid cardo-type OXD side chains endow this polymer with a very high glass transition temperature (306 °C) and good thermal stability, without sacrificing its good solution processability. Both in dilute solution and as a thin film, PFA-OXD exhibits a bright blue emission upon excitation of either the main chain or oxadiazole side chains; this phenomenon indicates that efficient energy transfer occurs from the photoexcited pendent groups to the polymer backbone. An organic light-emitting device incorporating this copolymer as the emitting layer exhibits a voltage-independent and stable blue emission having color coordinates (0.14, 0.15) at 9 V; the maximum brightness was 7128 cd m^{-2} and the maximum luminance efficiency was 2.07 cd A^{-1}. In addition, doping PFA-OXD as a host material with 2.6 wt % of a red-emitting phosphorescent dye, Os(fppz), led to a high-brightness, highly efficient red electroluminescent device having CIE coordinates of (0.65, 0.34), a maximum brightness of 28 440 cd m^{-2}, and a maximum external efficiency of 9.30 %.\n",

From NMR spectra, it is revealed that addition condensation reactions occurred exclusively at the para positions of TPD. TPD-FA polymer was linked not only by a methylene linkage but also by a methylene ether linkage, while TPD-BzA polymer was only linked by a methine linkage. The glass transition temperatures of TPD-FA and TPD-BzA were 183 and 239 °C, respectively.

      "The orientation of the crystal stems in diblock copolymers, where crystallization occurs within the cylindrical microdomains present in the melt mesophase, is investigated via X-ray scattering on flow-aligned specimens. A series of ethylene-b-(3-methyl-1-butene) diblocks (E/MB) is compared with an ethylene-b-(vinylcyclohexane) diblock (E/VCH), where MB is rubbery (T_{g} < T_{room}) and VCH is vitreous (T_{g} = 134 °C) at the freezing point of the E block. All of the diblocks contain 26-28 wt % E, leading to a morphology of hexagonally-packed E cylinders. Crystallization in all of these materials can be confined to the cylindrical microdomains. Not only do the crystals align preferentially within the semicrystalline cylinders, but this orientation varies depending on the ability of chains to diffuse during the crystallization process. When chain diffusion is most rapid, alignment is observed with the chain axis in the crystals perpendicular to the cylinder axis and the b axis (fast growth axis) coincident with the cylinder axis. However, when the chain mobility is limited, the crystal stems tilt with respect to a plane which is normal to the cylinder axis, allowing better accommodation of amorphous material at the crystallite surface.\n",

Permeation and sorption processes of different gases (hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene, and ethane) were measured in membranes prepared by casting from solutions of the copolymer in chloroform. The Langmuir capacity of the gases is relatively small due to the nearness of the glass transition temperature of the polymer to the working temperature. The solution of the most condensable gases in the continuous phase of the membrane is apparently described by the Flory-Huggins theory of polymer-diluent mixtures. In general, the membranes exhibit a reasonably high separation coefficient of hydrogen with respect to ethane, ethylene, nitrogen, and methane.

In comparison, at 110 °C, these same catalytic systems were more active toward the iROP of native TMC, whereas the iROP of the seven-membered analogue α-Me7CC generally featured a poorer control. The dissymmetry of α-MeTMC raises the question of catalyst selectivity in the ROP process. Detailed microstructural analyses of the poly(α-MeTMC)s using ^{1}H and ^{13}C NMR revealed (1) the preferential ring-opening at the most hindered oxygen-acyl O-C(O)O bond, ie, closest to the α-Me substituent of the zinc-based system, in the iROP of α-MeTMC, possibly as a result of the favorable steric hindrance; (2) the absence of regioselectivity of the aluminium or guanidine catalyst systems. In addition, MALDI-ToF-MS analyses confirmed the expected α-hydroxy,ω-alkoxyester chain-ends in these polymers. DSC analyses revealed a glass transition temperature of the poly(α-MeTMC)s (T_{g} ≈ -17 °C) similar to that of poly(TMC)s.\n",

      "A novel approach is described to obtain polymers which show significant lithium ion conductivity when blended with lithium salts. Polymerization of acrylates and methacrylates with 2-oxo-1,3-dioxolane (cyclic carbonate) containing side chains gives polymers which contain the structural element of the prototypical solvent propylene carbonate (PC) firmly attached to the polymer host. (2-Oxo-1,3-dioxolane-4-yl)methyl methacrylate (DOMA) and the corresponding acrylate (DOA) were obtained by reaction of the (meth)acryloyl chloride with glycerol carbonate while (2-oxo-1,3-dioxolane-4-yl)butyl methacrylate (DOBMA) and the respective acrylate (DOBA) were obtained from the ω-hexenyl esters by first epoxidation followed by CO_{2}-insertion into the oxirane ring. Free radical polymerization in DMF gave the desired polymers. All homopolymers were thermally stable at least up to 200 °C; the glass transition temperature was found for PDOMA at 93 °C, for PDOA at 50 °C, for PDOBMA at 16 °C, and for PDOBA at 11 °C. Free radical copolymerization of DOMA with butyl methacrylate (BMA) (r_{1} = 1.24, r_{2} = 0.80) gave copolymers with T_{g} dependent on the BMA content. Blends of the homopolymers with lithium bis(trifluoro)methane sulfonimide (LiTFSI) gave appreciable lithium ion conductivities, particularly for blends of PDOA (3.7 x 10^{-6} S cm^{-1} at 40 °C) which could be substantially increased by further blending with small amounts of propylene carbonate. These blends of honey-like consistency showed conductivities of 1.8 x 10^{-3} S cm^{-1} (40 °C) for PDOA and 5.1 x 10^{-4} S cm^{-1} (40 °C) for PDOBMA each blended with LiTFSI and PC at equimolar amounts. The temperature dependence of lithium ion conductivity follows a WLF-type behavior in all cases; however, the reference temperatures do not bear any correspondence to the observed glass transition temperatures but are estimated from modified WLF-plots to be positioned in a temperature regime typical for local side chain relaxations in common polymers.\n",

It has been found that 7CNCOOH has a clearing temperature of 150 °C and exhibits nematic mesophase, and PSHQ4-7CNCOOH exhibits both thermotropic and lyotropic characteristics. The thermotropic characteristics of PSHQ4-7CNCOOH have been investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fiber and powder patterns of wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and polarized optical microscopy (POM). It has been found that in the thermotropic state PSHQ4-7CNCOOH has a glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of 85 °C and a nematic-to-isotropic (N-I) transition temperature (T_{NI}) of 172 °C, and it is a glassy polymer. Interestingly, PSHQ4-7CNCOOH is found to exhibit lyotropic characteristics, undergoing isotropic-to-nematic biphasic separation over a wide range of concentrations in m-dibromobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, and tetrachloroethane, enabling us to construct a phase diagram. The thermal transitions and phase structures of the main-chain backbone of PSHQ4-7CNCOOH, PSHQ4, were compared with those of PSHQ4-7CNCOOH. It has been found that PSHQ4 has a T_{g} of ca. 130 °C and a T_{NI} of ca. 260 °C, and it undergoes, during isothermal annealing, crystallization at about 240 °C as determined from DSC. Both the fiber and powder patterns of WAXD indicate that PSHQ4 is a semicrystalline polymer, which is consistent with the findings from DSC. It has been found that, in contrast to PSHQ4-7CNCOOH, PSHQ4 does not exhibit lyotropic characteristics. Both the very large decrease (about 90 °C) in T_{NI} after the attachment of side-chain mesogenic groups (7CNCOOH) onto the main-chain backbone (PSHQ4) and the lyotropic characteristics of PSHQ4-7CNCOOH are attributable to the significant increase in the bulkiness of PSHQ4-7CNCOOH, which apparently cannot pack well, giving rise to a glassy state.\n",

The DSC results revealed that the glass transition temperatures (T_{g}) of the enantiopure polymers and the racemic polymer are approximately the same with a T_{g} of ~50 °C. However, the enantiopure polymers showed an additional transition due to cold-crystallization (T_{cc}) followed by two melting peaks (T_{m1} and T_{m2}). Extended thermal investigations indicated that the double melting peak is caused by the melt-recrystallization mechanism. The XRD results confirmed that the enantiopure polymers are semicrystalline and p-RS-BuEtOx is amorphous and that no change in crystalline structure appears during the melting transitions. Furthermore, comparison of the DSC results with the CD measurements of the polymer film revealed that the crystals formed during the cold crystallization have an ordered chiral structure, which almost completely disappears during melting.\n",

      "A new poly(2-alkyl-2-oxazoline) having a branched side chain, namely, 2-(3-ethylheptyl)-2-oxazoline (EHOx), was synthesized. The microwave-assisted homopolymerization as well as the copolymerization with 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline (EtOx) are reported, whereby the determination of the reactivity ratios indicates the occurrence of a random polymerization. Further studies were performed regarding the thermal and the surface properties. p(EHOx) showed a glass transition of -6 °C, whereas no melting temperature could be detected, representing the amorphous poly(2-oxazoline) with the lowest reported T_{g} to date. Furthermore, the systematic random copolymerization with EtOx in the range from 0 to 100 % EHOx revealed a linear dependence of T_{g} with composition as well as a complex dependence of the surface energy on the composition showing two plateau regimes.\n",

      "New fluorescent fluorenevinylene copolymers incorporating bis(phenyl)oxadiazole, triphenylamine, or both moieties were synthesized, characterized, and used as the emissive materials in efficient electroluminescent diodes. In dilute solutions, the copolymers had blue-green fluorescence with high quantum yields of 0.76-0.87. All the copolymers had high glass transition temperatures (T_{g} = 147-160 °C) and outstanding thermal stability. Light emitting diodes based on the neat copolymer thin films showed bright greenish-yellow electroluminescence, with luminances of up to 1360 cd/m^{2}, originating mostly from intramolecular charge-transfer excited states due to the presence of the donor/acceptor moieties in the copolymers. However, dilute (approximately 5 wt %) binary blends of the copolymers with poly(vinyl carbazole) gave stable blue electroluminescence (CIE = 0.17, 0.16) with higher luminances (1770-3400 cd/m^{2}) and luminous efficiencies of up to 1.34 cd/A.\n",

      "The synthesis of poly(thienylene vinylenes) (PTV) has been attracting attention due to the low band gaps and high electrical conductivities of these materials, making them applicable for charge storage devices, transparent conductive coatings, and electrochromic devices. Unsubstituted PTV is an intractable polymer that is usually synthesized via a processable precursor. This article reports the synthesis of conjugated polymers using solid-state metathesis conditions, demonstrating the efficiency of this methodology for preparation of a processable polymer, such a 3-dodecyl PTV (P3DDTV). The 3-dodecyl-2,5-dipropenylthiophene was synthesized and subsequently polymerized using ADMET conditions with Grubbs' second-generation catalyst. The prepolymer film (M_{n} = 4000 g/mol) was further polymerized in the solid state to give a final product with M_{n} = 14 000 g/mol (a 3.5-fold increase while in the solid state). The polymer obtained by this methodology exhibited thermal (T_{g} = 43 °C and T_{m} = 115 °C) and electrochemical (optical band gap of 1.65 eV and HOMO energy level of 5.35 eV) properties similar to those of PTV polymers synthesized by ADMET polymerization using a high boiling solvent or by cross-coupling reactions.\n",

      "Four discrete half-sandwich dialkyl rare earth metal (REM) complexes incorporating a disilylated indenyl ligand, (1,3-(SiMe_{3})_{2}C_{9}H_{5})M(CH_{2}SiMe_{3})_{2}(THF) (M = Sc, Y, Dy, Lu), have been investigated for the coordination-addition polymerization of naturally renewable methylene butyrolactones, α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone (MBL) and γ-methyl-α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone (MMBL). Initial screening for the polymerization of methyl methacrylate highlighted several differences in catalytic behavior between these half-sandwich REM catalysts and well-studied sandwich REM catalysts in terms of reactivity trend, polymer tacticity, and solvent dependence. Most significantly, all four catalysts herein exhibit exceptional activity for polymerization of MMBL in DMF, achieving quantitative monomer conversion in <1 min with a 0.20 mol % catalyst loading and giving a high turnover frequency of >30 000 h^{-1}. Slower polymerizations occur in CH_{2}Cl_{2}, allowing for establishment of the activity trend within this REM series, which follows: Dy (largest ion) >= Y > Lu > Sc (smallest ion). The most active and effective Dy catalyst has been examined in detail, demonstrating its ability to control the polymerization for producing PMMBL with high T_{g} (221 °C) and with molecular weight ranging from a medium M_{n} of 1.89 x 10^{4} Da to a high M_{n} of 1.63 x 10^{5} Da, programmed by the [MMBL]/[Dy] ratio. Kinetic experiments have revealed a first-order dependence on [monomer] and a second-order dependence on [REM]. These kinetic results, coupled to catalyst efficiencies, NMR studies, as well as with chain-end group analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, have yielded a chain initiation mechanism that involves both alkyl groups on each metal center and a bimolecular chain propagation that involves two metal centers in the rate-limiting C-C bond forming step. The Dy catalyst response to enolizable organo acids, externally added as chain-transfer agents, has also been examined.\n",

      "The first novel polyfluorene copolymers containing siloxane bridges were synthesized by Ni(0)-mediated copolymerization between 2,7-dibromo-9,9'-dihexylfluorene and a bridged fluorene monomer containing siloxane linkages. Two such bridged copolymers were prepared: PSiloBg1 (containing 1 mol % siloxane-bridged fluorene unit) and PSiloBg3 (containing 3 mol % siloxane-bridged fluorene unit). PSiloBg1 and PSiloBg3 exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents, thermal stability up to 420 °C, and facile film formation. The glass transition temperatures of the bridged polymers (106 and 110 °C, respectively) were higher than that of the homo poly(dihexylfluorene) (PDHF). In particular, PSiloBg3 exhibited a polymerization yield (96 %) and a molecular weight (MW = 185 000) higher than those of PDHF (polymerization yield = 62 %, MW = 82 000). Interestingly, after the bridged polymers had been annealed at 150 °C for 4 h in air, their PL spectra showed no significant increase in vibronic structures at 450 and 475 nm and no evidence of aggregation formation and excimers at wavelengths of >500 nm. In addition, the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the bridged polymers was very small (fwhm = 51-52 nm) compared to that of PDHF (fwhm = 85 nm). Collectively, the results show that the polyfluorenes with siloxane bridges exhibit thermally stable almost pure blue emission, making these polymers promising candidate materials for device applications.\n",

      "In this study, we investigate the selectivity for copolymer versus cyclic carbonate production from the coupling of isomeric forms of butene oxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of binary and bifunctional cobalt(III) and chromium(III) salicylaldimine catalysts. Use of the less problematic 1-butene oxide has previously been reported to preferentially afford copolymer from its coupling with CO_{2}. Of the epoxides, cis- and trans-2-butene oxide and isobutene oxide, only cis-2-butene oxide was shown to selectively provide polycarbonate, with both cobalt(III) catalysts being more effective than their chromium(III) analogues. The binary chromium catalyst system produced both cis- and trans-cyclic carbonates from the cycloaddition of CO_{2} and cis-2-butene oxide, whereas, the corresponding cobalt(III) catalyst selectively yielded 75.4 % copolymer at 40 °C with the remaining product being trans-cyclic carbonate. In this instance, the trans-cyclic carbonate results from copolymer degradation, consistent with the observation that depolymerization of the copolymer derived from CO_{2} and cis-2-butene oxide affords trans-cyclic carbonate exclusively. By way of contrast, both bifunctional catalysts were efficient at producing copolymers with selectivities of 100 % (40 °C) and 79 % (70 °C) for the cobalt and chromium catalysts, respectively. The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of poly(trans-2-butene carbonate) derived from the completely alternating copolymerization of CO_{2} and cis-2-butene oxide was found to be 68 °C, some 30 deg higher than poly(propylene carbonate). Furthermore, it was shown to have a significantly lower % elongation-to-break value than poly(propylene carbonate).\n",

      "An original design strategy for the preparation of polymers with a low dielectric constant is presented. The key to this design strategy is taking the most advantage of the secondary relaxation behavior of the polymer chains to obtain more free volume in the bulk, which can effectively reduce the dielectric constant of the polymer. By using this design strategy, we have successfully synthesized a novel polyimide TmBPHF with a pendant group that consists of a biphenyl unit attached to the meta-position of a phenyl ring that is part of a triaryl unit. The intrinsic k and dielectric loss values of the TmBPHF are 2.09 and 0.0012 at 10 kHz, respectively. More importantly, such outstanding low-k performance remains stable up to 300 °C. The excellent low-k performance of TmBPHF is mainly due to the secondary relaxation, especially the β relaxation, which occurs from the rotation of the pendant group. The TmBPHF film shows an ultralow moisture rate (~0.17 %), which is able to maintain the low-k property stability in different humid environments. Meanwhile, the TmBPHF film also shows excellent thermal stability and excellent mechanical properties, with a glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of 302 °C, 5 wt % decomposition temperature (T _{d5 %}) of 549 °C, and residual of 70 % at 800 °C under N_{2}. The tensile strength and tensile modulus of the polyimide film are equal to 85.8 MPa and 2.02 GPa, respectively. In addition, the TmBPHF film is soluble in common solvents, which allows simple solution processing and efficient, low-cost, and continuous roll-to-roll processes. The design strategy is beneficial for lowering the k value and simultaneously maintaining the overall properties of polyimides, which possibly could also be extended to other novel high-performance polymer systems.\n",

      "As a cheap and easily obtainable raw material, epichlorohydrin is an attractive candidate for copolymerization with CO_{2} to produce degradable polycarbonate. However, the poor polymer selectivity as well as the concomitant production of ether linkage units in the previous studies hindered further research on this topic, such as asymmetric, stereo- and regioselective ring-opening of epichlorohydrin during its copolymerizaton with CO_{2}. Herein, we report highly stereospecific alternating copolymerization of CO_{2} and epichlorohydrin for the first time by utilizing chiral bifunctional cobalt-salen catalysts. It was found that the substituents on the phenonate groups around the metal center had a notable effect on the regioselectivity of the ring-opening step for epichlorohydrin. Using an enantiopure salenCo(III) complex bearing an adamantane group and an appended bulky dicyclohexyl ionic ammonium salt, a highly regioregular ring-opening step was observed with a concomitant 97 % retention of configuration at the methine carbon center. The isotactic poly(chloropropylene carbonate) is a typical semicrystalline polymer with an enhanced T_{g} of 42 °C and a T_{m} of 108 °C. The test of mechanical properties shows that the yield strength and tensile strength of the crystalline copolymer are about 10 and 30 times that of its amorphous counterpart, respectively.\n",

At room temperature, PBHS adopts a hexagonal columnar mesophase. Upon cooling to 250 K or below, a complex first-order phase transformation takes place, leading to three other forms: a 7/3 helical form, an all-trans form, and an intermediate form with unknown conformation. The amount of each form depends on the thermal history of the sample.

      "We have selected two amorphous all-aromatic poly(ether imide)s with similar chemical structures but with different backbone geometries as matrices for SWCNT-based nanocomposites. Up to 4.4 vol %, SWCNTs could be incorporated using an in situ polymerization method. Nanocomposites prepared from aBPDA-P3, a nonlinear matrix polymer with a T_{g} of 230 °C, remains amorphous, and the presence of the SWCNTs reduces the T_{g} by 11 °C. No effect on E' or stress-strain behavior was observed. When ODPA-P3 was used as the matrix, the SWCNTs appear to be highly compatible with this more linear polymer host. The SWCNTs act as a nucleating agent at concentrations as low as 0.1 vol %. XRD and TEM measurements show that the SWCNTs become embedded in a highly crystalline polymer matrix. The result is a significant change in thermomechanical properties. The polymer T_{g} was increased by 12 °C, from 196 to 208 °C, and due to the induced crystallinity, the modulus above T_{g} showed a dramatic increase. The neat polymer fails at T_{g}, but the 4.4 vol % nanocomposite shows a storage modulus of 1 GPa at 280 °C. Stress-strain measurements show a noticeable improvement in strain and toughness at low SWCNT loadings (0.1-0.3 wt %), which is indicative of good stress transfer between the SWCNTs and polymer matrix. At higher loadings the yield strength increases from 80 to 126 MPa at 4.5 % strain. Our findings show that the poly(ether imide) backbone geometry determines whether the polymer is good host for SWCNTs. The more linear ODPA-P3 is able to maximize its interaction with the SWCNT surface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an amorphous polymer has been shown to develop a semicrystalline morphology in the presence of SWCNTs. Steric factors in aBPDA-P3 seem to inhibit favorable π-π interactions and prevent the polymer chains from adapting low-energy conformations that readily interact with the SWCNT surface.\n",

The triblock copolymer, PMPCS-b-PB-b-PMPCS (M-B-M), was synthesized by ring-opening metathesis polymerization in the presence of a chain transfer agent and atom transfer radical polymerization. The glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of the PMPCS hard block is 110-118 °C in the triblock copolymers. In addition, the liquid crystalline (LC) phase of PMPCS is stable before thermal decomposition. All the triblock copolymers form lamellar microphase-separated structures, as demonstrated by small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy results. The triblock copolymer (M-B-M-55) with a mass fraction of 55 % of PMPCS exhibits typical properties of an LC thermoplastic elastomer (LCTPE). The maximum elongation at break and the tensile strength of M-B-M-55 are 736 % and 10.6 MPa, respectively, and the stretching strength at 300 % is 6.9 MPa.

In parallel, a solution polymerization process afforded a range of poly(CTFE-co-VDC) copolymers of lower molecular weight and soluble enough to allow a meticulous characterization by NMR spectroscopy. Various statistical poly(CTFE-co-VDC) copolymers were synthesized, containing from 3 to 38 mol % of VDC. A triple resonance (^{1}H/ ^{13}C/^{19}F) 2D-NMR ^{1}H{ ^{13}C}-HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence) experiment was used to aid with resonance assignments and provided crucial information about monomer sequences.

These variations of the thermal properties were attributed to an increase in the number of C-H bonds broken in polymers with higher VDC molar percentages in the copolymer.

Herein, we report a methodology for the synthesis of acetylene-functionalized clickable polymers via conventional free radical polymerization of a novel acrylate bearing tertiary acetylene, 1-ethynylcyclohexyl acrylate (ECA). This methodology allows the acetylene-functionalized polymers to be prepared by conventional free radical polymerizations without the need to protect the acetylene group before polymerization and without the help of an ATRP/RAFT agent. The characteristics of ECA in free radical polymerization and copolymerization including bulk polymerization and conventional solution polymerization at varied concentrations and reaction times were studied. High molecular weight acetylene-functionalized polymers were prepared and were characterized by SEC, ^{1}H-NMR, FTIR and DSC. When ECA was coploymerized with methyl acrylate, as the feed ratio of ECA increased, the rate of the polymerization reaction and the molecular weight of the copolymer decreased while the molecular weight distribution (PDI) slightly increased.

Atom-efficient direct arylation polymerization (DArP) was exploited to synthesize the polymer. Mechanical studies indicate that PIDTBPD has relatively rapid stress-relaxation properties, which lead to a low elastic modulus of 200 MPa and high crack-onset strain of ca. 40 % (lower limit). A moderate charge carrier mobility of 2 x 10^{-3} cm^{2} V^{-1} s^{-1} with a current on/off ratio of 2.5 x 10^{6} was obtained from the fabricated OFETs. Further experiments were performed to elucidate the structural aspects of this polymer: UV-Vis and PL spectra suggest that minimal conformational change occurs in the polymer between its diluted solution and thin film states; DSC measurements indicate that the polymer's T_{g} is below -20 °C, allowing it to be in a rubbery state at room temperature; and XRD studies support this observation suggesting that the polymer is mostly amorphous at room temperature.\n",

The observation of a melting temperature (T_{m}) depended upon the thermal history of the polymer. Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) confirmed the formation of a nematic glass morphology after quench-cooling from the isotropic state.

      "Over the last decade or so, polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) has become widely recognized as a versatile technique for the rational synthesis of diblock copolymer nano-objects in the form of concentrated dispersions. However, there are relatively few examples of acrylic-based PISA formulations in the literature, partly because such copolymers typically possess relatively low glass transition temperatures (T_{g}) that preclude morphological characterization by transmission electron microscopy. To address this problem, we have selected phenyl acrylate (PhA) as a model monomer to generate the solvophobic block in three PISA formulations using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Thus, a poly(dimethyl acrylamide)-based chain transfer agent (CTA) is chain-extended using PhA via RAFT aqueous emulsion polymerization to produce a series of well-defined sterically-stabilized spheres whose mean diameter can be readily adjusted from 38 nm to 188 nm by varying the target degree of polymerization (DP). In contrast, RAFT alcoholic dispersion polymerization of PhA using a poly(acrylic acid) CTA leads to an evolution of copolymer morphology from spheres to worms to lamellae and finally vesicles as the target DP of the structure-directing PPhA block is increased. Similarly, RAFT dispersion polymerization of PhA in n-heptane also produces spheres, worms or vesicles depending on the target DP of the PPhA block. ^{1}H NMR studies indicate that >98 % PhA conversion is achieved in all cases, while GPC analysis indicates high blocking efficiencies. However, relatively broad molecular weight distributions are observed (M_{w}/M_{n} = 1.37 to 2.48), which suggests extensive chain transfer to polymer in such PISA syntheses, particularly in the case of the RAFT aqueous emulsion polymerization formulation. Nevertheless, the relatively high T_{g} of PPhA (50 °C) enables characterization of the various copolymer morphologies using conventional TEM.\n",

      "The synthesis and radical co- and terpolymerizations of α-trifluoromethylstyrene (TFMST) with various fluorinated and hydrogenated comonomers are presented. The selected fluorinated comonomers were: vinylidene fluoride (VDF), chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), 3,3,3-trifluoropropene (TFP), 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-1-decyl vinyl ether (FAVE-8), while the hydrogenated one was ethyl vinyl ether (EVE). Though the homopolymerization and most copolymerizations of TFMST failed, the radical terpolymerization of TFMST with VDF and CTFE led to successful reaction in ca. 40-80 % yield, when the TFMST feed was lower than 9 mol %. The resulting terpolymers were characterized by ^{1}H and^{19}F NMR spectroscopy that enabled to assess the molar percentages of the three comonomer units and revealed VDF-TFMST and CTFE-TFMST dyads besides expected VDF-VDF, VDF-CTFE, CTFE-CTFE dyads, and various triads composed of these monomers. Molecular weights were in the range of 2000-5000 g mol^{-1} indicating that oligomers were obtained. TGA under air indicated that poly(CTFE-ter-VDF-ter-TFMST) terpolymers do not degrade below 150 °C, while DSC experiments confirmed the terpolymer structure as only a single glass transition temperature at about -35 °C.\n",

In case of ROP-PEA, cyclic oligo(ethylene adipate) (C-OEA) was equilibrated in the presence of di-n-butyltin oxide as a catalyst under high-concentration conditions at 180 and 200 °C for 1-24 h. The polymer products were obtained in yields up to 100 % with the M-n and M-w in the ranges of 3000-23 000 g/mol and 5000-60 000 g/mol, respectively.

The copolyester produced was obtained in yield of 97 % with the M-n and M-w of 18 000 and 46 000 g/mol, respectively. ^{1}H NMR spectrum of ROP-PEA-co-PET showed two new proton signals of ethylene unit representing the existence of heterolinkage with different chemical environment in the copolymer. This indicated the random transesterification of C-OEA and C-OET resulting in random structure in copolyester. In addition, the result of ROP-PEA-co-PET from DSC showed the glass transition temperature in the values of -8 °C with no melting temperature indicating thermoplastic elastomeric behavior.\n",

But the resulting polymers had low molecular weights at 0 or -50 °C. In contrast, the polymerization of EHPE at -78 °C almost quantitatively proceeded, and the number-average molecular weight (M_{n}) of the obtained polymers increased in direct proportion to the EHPE conversion with quite narrow molecular weight distributions (weight-average molecular weight/number-average molecular weight <= 1.05). In monomer-addition experiments, the M_{n} of the polymers shifted higher with low polydispersity as the polymerization proceeded, indicative of living polymerization. In the polymerization of methyl 2-propenyl ether (MPE), the living-like propagation also occurred under the reaction conditions similar to those for EHPE, but the elimination of the pendant methoxy groups was observed. The introduction of a more stable terminal group, quenched with sodium diethyl malonate, suppressed this decomposition, and the living polymerization proceeded. The glass transition temperature of the obtained poly(MPE) was 34 °C, which is much higher than that of the corresponding poly(vinyl ether). This poly(MPE) had solubility characteristics that differed from those of poly(vinyl ethers).\n",

The glass transition temperature of copolymers in nitrogen ranged from 110 to 148 °C, and the copolymers showed high thermal stabilities with high decomposition temperatures in the range of 350 to 390 °C in air. The difference in linkage position of pyridinyl unit in the polymer backbone has significant effects on the electronic and optical properties of polymers in solution and in film phases. Meta-linkage (3,5- and 2,6-linkage) of pyridinyl units in the polymer backbone is more favorable to polymer for pure blue emission and prevention of aggregation of polymer chain than para-linkage (2,5-linkage) of the pyridinyl units.\n",

For the study, PSHQ10 was synthesized via solution polymerization in our laboratory. The PSHQ10 was found to have (a) the weight-average molecular weight of 45000 relative to polystyrene standards and a polydispersity index of 2, (b) a glass transition temperature of 88 °C, (c) a melting point of 115 °C, and (d) a nematic-to-isotropic transition temperature of 175 °C. For the measurements of σ and N_{1} in the nematic region of PSHQ10, its initial conditions for the startup of shear flow was controlled by (a) first heating an as-cast specimen to 190 °C, (b) shearing there at γ = 0.085 s^{-1} for about 5 min, and then (c) cooling slowly down to a predetermined temperature (130, 140, 150, 160, or 171 °C) in the nematic region. For each γ chosen, after start-up of shear flow, we waited for a sufficiently long time until both the shear stress and first normal stress difference leveled off, giving rise to steady-state values of σ and N_{1}. Emphasis was placed on investigating the effect of shear history on σ and N_{1} of PSHQ10 in the nematic region. For this, the following experiments were conducted: (a) a fresh specimen was sheared continuously by increasing the γ stepwise, and (b) a presheared specimen was further sheared continuously by increasing the γ stepwise. We have found that fresh specimens exhibited 'shear-thinning' behavior over the entire range of γ (0.008-0.27 s^{-1}) tested, whereas the presheared specimens exhibited both zero-shear viscosities and shear-thinning behavior. When using fresh specimens, we found that N_{1} was positive over the entire range of γ (0.008-0.27 s^{-1}) tested. However, when using presheared specimens we found that (a) at very low γ, N_{1} initially was negative and then became positive as shearing continued, and (b) at higher γ, N_{1} was positive over the entire duration of shearing.\n",

The copolymer structure was confirmed by means of FTIR and [1H] NMR spectra. DSC analysis showed PTCSA was semicrystalline polymer which had low T_{g} (<-30 °C). The measurements of contact angles indicated that the hydrophobicity of PTCSA increased as the content of carbonate segments increased. In vitro degradation of PTCSA was performed in lipase-free and lipase-containing phosphate-buffer saline (0.1 M, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. It was found that the degradation rate of PTCSA increased with the amount of SA. After 7 days of degradation in lipase-free phosphate-buffer saline, the weight loss of PTCSA was 74, 49 and 22 % for 80, 58 and 32 mol % SA contained samples, respectively. The weight loss of PTCSA increased rapidly in the first week, then slowed down but could be greatly enhanced by lipase. After 3 weeks of degradation with or without lipase, the weight loss of PTCSA was 66 and 52 % for 58 mol % SA-containing samples, respectively. The size of the samples was gradually reduced and the surface became coarse. It was also found that the molecular weights of the outer layer were lower than those of the inner layer of the samples after degradation.

Here, we present dielectric and mechanical spectroscopy studies on segmental motions and network relaxation processes in linear poly(MEO_{2}MA) and its networks -- bare network and the network grafted with short poly(MEO_{2}MA) chains. We show that the α process assigned to the segmental motions of poly(MEO_{2}MA) is independent on the polymer topology and the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, associated with this process equals 235-236 K for all investigated systems. The α' relaxation observed above T_{g} by dynamical mechanical analysis is assigned to the sub-Rouse process.

The addition of tetrahydrofuran could enhance the rate of synthesis and effect the microstructure. The T_{m} was higher for PDMB with a lower content of 1,2-structure, and the T_{g} was lower. This PDMB was then hydrogenated with a nickelocene/n-butyllithium catalyst system leading to the formation of HPDMB.

      "A novel amide and imide copolymer, poly(N-phenylmethacrylamide-co-N-(p-hydroxyphenyl)maleimide) was synthesized for the matrix resin of ultraviolet (UV) photoresist. Elemental analysis and self-polymerization experiment verified that this copolymer was very close to 1:1 (molar ratio) in composition and was predominately alternating. It was able to dissolve in various organic solvents and form uniform curing film when spin-coating. Its differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry analysis test showed good thermal stability and its glass transition temperature (T_{g}) was about 280 °C. Photolithographic experiment indicated that the UV photoresist formulated with this copolymer as matrix resin was achieved the resolution of about 5 μm, the contrast of 3.001, and the sensitivity of 32 mJ/cm^{2}. With good plasma etching resistance, the photoresist studied was able to bear 250 °C for 30 min without thermal deformation during the thermal resistance test. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2009.\n",

      "The crystallization kinetics of syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS) were studied using nonisothermal DSC analysis. Crystallization rates and half-times were determined from the glass transition temperature (~ 100 °C) up to the melt temperature (~ 270 °C) for various molecular weight SPS polymers. The results suggest that the crystallization rate of SPS is molecular weight dependent. These results are also compared with previously determined crystallization kinetics of high density polyethylene. The maximum crystallization rate of high density polyethylene is approximately ten times greater than that of SPS.\n",

According to the specific retention volumes, the weight fraction activity coefficients of solute probes at infinite dilution, Ω_{1} ^{∞}, and Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (χ ^{∞}_{12}) between poly (PDMMA-co-GMA)-solvents were determined in 423-463K. According to and, selected alcohols and n-alkanes were found to be nonsolvent for poly (PDMMA-co-GMA) between 423 and 463K. Also, the solubility parameters, δ_{2}, of poly (PDMMA-co-GMA) were found to be 22.15 (J cm^{-3})^{0.5} and 25.50 (J cm^{-3})^{0.5} from slope and intercept of [(/RT) - /V_{1}) = (2δ_{2}/RT)δ_{1} - /RT equation, at 443K, respectively. The glass transition temperature (T_{g} ) of the poly (PDMMA-co-GMA) was found to be 370 and 367K, respectively, by inverse gas chromatography and differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) techniques.\n",

      "The preparation and characterization of 6,6'-bis(3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2H-1,3-benzoxazinyl)isopropane (1) and 6,6'-bis(3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2H-1,3-benzoxazinyl)sulfone (2) using FTIR, ^{1}H and ^{13}C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, is reported. Molecular simulation using both molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics techniques are reported for poly(bis-benzoxazine)s of both materials and the data compare well with literature values for the polymer of (1). The same methodology is extended to predict a T_{g} for the polymer of the newly-prepared, novel monomer (2), for which no published data currently exist. Preliminary measurements of the thermal behaviour, particularly the T_{g} values, of the monomers and polymers are made using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The latter show very good agreement for 6,6'-bis(3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2H-1,3-benzoxazinyl)isopropane (an accepted literature value of T_{g} for this polymer is 180 °C; the onset of T_{g} from our empirical DSC measurement is ca. 177 °C, and the extrapolated value of T_{g} from simulation is 180 °C). In the case of the new monomer, 6,6'-bis(3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2H-1,3-benzoxazinyl)sulfone, the predicted T_{g} from simulation lies in the range 120-150 °C (with an extrapolated value at 130 °C) and the empirical DSC measurement yields an onset value of ca. 117 °C.\n",

      "Four nonlinear optical maleimide copolymers were synthesized by radical copolymerization of N-phenylmaleimide and methacrylate-based or styrene-based monomer with benzoxazole chromophores, respectively. The copolymers had high glass transition temperatures of 158 °C and exhibited good thermal stability. The most transparent film was prepared from a alternating copolymer (PMIBz 2) derived from N-phenylmaleimide and styrene-based NLO monomer. The second harmonic generation coefficient and electro-optical coefficient (r_{33}) of a poled PMIBz 2 film was 45 pm/V (at 1.064 μm) and 6.1 pm/V (at 1.3 μm), respectively.

      "In dilute solutions, polyelectrolytes exhibit more hydrophilic properties than non-charged polymers do. However, extension of this statement on almost dry systems is questionable. In this study we present sorption calorimetric data on hydration of a natural carbohydrate polyelectrolyte xanthan gum and make comparison with analogous data of three types of cellulose which is a non-charged carbohydrate polymer. An analysis of the sorption isotherm shows that at given relative humidities xanthan gum absorbs greater amount of water than non-charged cellulose does. Nonetheless, the enthalpies of hydration of xanthan gum and of all three considered types of cellulose at zero water content are equal to -18 kJ/mol. Thus, entropy of hydration plays an important role in water sorption behaviour of xanthan gum. The apparent absence of an ion effect on polymer-water interactions can be explained by solvation of ions by OH-groups of the dry xanthan gum. Ab initio calculations presented here show that solvation of an ionic group of xanthan gum by a carbohydrate hydroxyl is as strong as hydration of the same group by water. The exothermic heat effect of hydration arises from the loss of the mobility of water on the rigid glassy environment of the polymer. For the first time, the glass transition temperature of dry xanthan gum is reported to be 60 °C.\n",

      "The thermal performance of aromatic polyesters (poly(DPA-IPC), poly(MDP-IPC) and poly(EDP-IPC)) prepared from isophthaloyl chloride (IPC) with diphenolic acid (DPA) and its esters were studied with DSC and TG, and the decomposition mechanism of poly(DPA-IPC) were investigated using FTIR and integrated TG/FTIR analyses. As compared with ordinary aromatic polyesters, poly(DPA-IPC) has lower glass transition temperature (159 °C) and much lower thermal stability. It starts to decompose at about 210 °C and is characterized by two-stage thermal decomposition behavior, with active energies of decomposition of 206 kJ/mol and 389 kJ/mol, respectively. The analyses of the decomposition process and products indicate that the pendent carboxyl groups in poly(DPA-IPC) are responsible for its low thermal stability. Accordingly, a decomposition mechanism for the first stage is proposed. With this knowledge in mind, we capped the carboxyl groups in DPA with methyl and ethyl groups to prepare poly(MDP-IPC) and poly(EDP-IPC) from methyl diphenolate and ethyl dipenolate. As expected, these two polymers exhibit obviously improved thermal stability, with onset decomposition temperature of about 300 °C.\n",

      "Polymers from renewable resources are of high interest since it could be possible to valorize the biomass and in parallel to tune their macromolecular structures in relation with their properties. Here novel bisfuranic-pyridinic copolyesters, namely poly (ethylene furoate-co-ethylene pyridinate) (PEBF-co-PEPy) were prepared by applying a two-stage melt polycondensation method at high temperature, in a presence of titanium derivatives as catalyst. Molecular weights of resulting copolyesters are in the range 24000-45200 g mol^{-1} and their chemical microstructures statistical as shown by NMR. These furano-pyridinic copolyesters are amorphous with Tg ranging from 62 to 67 °C and their thermal and hydrolysis stabilities are influenced by presence of the pyridinic dyads Py-ED-Py. Finally the oxidative degradation in H_{2}O_{2}/CoCl_{2} cannot be effective because of the chelating properties of pyridinic moieties.\n",

The polymer's structure was confirmed by IR and ^{1}H NMR spectroscopy. DSC analysis showed PACA had a low T_{g} (< -30 °C).

      "Aim of this study was to develop a temperature-controlled polyurethane (PU) film for the application in film coated clothes. The PU film should be a smart one that can control its water vapor permeability (WVP) through temperature change. The study was carried out by increasing the water vapor permeability of various breathable/waterproof PU films through variations of their hard-to-soft-segment ratio, PEG content, and isocyanate index; the thermal properties and morphologies were investigated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that the WVP of the PU film (MDI/PEG/PBA/1,4-BD = 3:0.6:0.4:2) can control its WVP by temperature change by itself. The WVP of the PU film started to rise obviously at 18 °C which is near the material's glass transition temperature (23.88 °C). The result also showed that the PEG content affected the WVP dramatically; higher water permeabilities occurred at higher percentages of PEG in the main chain, but with concomitant decreases in the mechanical strengths. The most permeable PU film had a WVP of 6745 g/m^{2}/day, a tensile strength of 29.38 MPa, and a tear strength of 112 kg/cm.\n",

      "A series of elastomers were investigated, by measuring their toluene permeability and acid resistance, for their potential for use in the extraction of organics from hydrochloric acid and other membrane processes utilising acidic aqueous phases. In this study, toluene was used as a solute in aqueous solution to measure permeabilities of the elastomers, and their acid resistance was assessed after immersion in 37 wt. % hydrochloric acid by tensile-strain tests. Silicone rubber has the highest permeability among the elastomers investigated in this study, but it has poor resistance to concentrated HCl. Polyoctenamer is the best membrane material in terms of permeability and acid resistance. Other olefin based materials such as poly(ethylene-co-propylene) and poly(ethylene-co-propylene-co-diene) (EPDM) are also good candidates. The permeability generally decreases with an increase in T_{g} for the elastomers investigated. However, for the EPDM materials with T_{g} values grouped around -60 °C, the relationship between T_{g} and permeabilities is not clear. A model derived from Flory-Huggins Theory and the Hildebrand and Scatchard equation was used to predict the partition coefficients of toluene between the elastomers and aqueous solution, and the predictive power found to depend critically on the value employed for the water solubility parameter. The diffusion coefficients of toluene in the elastomers can be explained by considering the polymer structure.\n",

      "Side-chain-type sulfonated poly(arylene ether)s bearing sulfoalkyl pendant groups (PSA-SPAEs) as proton exchange membranes for fuel cells were prepared via nucleophilic substitution polycondensation reactions of sodium 3-(4-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl)phenyl)propane-1-sulfonate (SDFPPS), 4,4'-dihydroxyldiphenylether (DHDPE) and 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone (DCDPS). The sulfonic acid group content (SC), as the quantity per repeat unit of polymer, ranging from 0.5 to 0.8, was readily controlled by changing the feed ratio of SDFPPS to DCDPS. Good thermal properties of PSA-SPAE copolymers were indicated by observing glass transition temperatures (T_{g}s) ranging from 210 to 230 °C in sodium salt form and decomposition temperatures (T_{d}s) over 220 °C in acid-form and over 400 °C in sodium-form in air. All PSA-SPAE membranes exhibited reasonable flexibility and tensile strength in the range of 41-78 MPa. PSA-SPAE copolymers bearing sulfonic acid groups on flexible side chains showed considerably reduced swelling ratio and improved proton conductivities. Proton conductivity curves parallel to those of Nafion 117 were obtained with proton conductivity of 10^{-1} S/cm at equivalent ion exchange capacities (IEC) of 1.47 and 1.64, comparable to Nafion 117. PSA-SPAE copolymer with SC 0.8 had the best data including PEM mechanical strength, water swelling and proton conductivity.\n"
